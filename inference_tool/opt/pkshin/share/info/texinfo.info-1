Texinfo Copying Conditions
**************************

GNU Texinfo is "free software"; this means that everyone is free to use
it and free to redistribute it on certain conditions.  Texinfo is not in
the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its
distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit everything
that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed
is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of Texinfo
that they might get from you.

   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of the programs that relate to Texinfo, that you receive
source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.

   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of the Texinfo related programs, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for the programs that relate to
Texinfo.  If these programs are modified by someone else and passed on,
we want their recipients to know that what they have is not what we
distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on our reputation.

   The precise conditions of the licenses for the programs currently
being distributed that relate to Texinfo are found in the General Public
Licenses that accompany them.  This manual is covered by the GNU Free

1 Overview of Texinfo
*********************

"Texinfo" is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both online information and printed output.  This means that
instead of writing several different documents, one for each output
format, you need only write one document.

   Using Texinfo, you can create a printed document (via the TeX
typesetting system) in PDF or PostScript format, including chapters,
sections, cross-references, and indices.  From the same Texinfo source
file, you can create an HTML output file suitable for use with a web
browser, you can create an Info file with special features to make
browsing documentation easy, and also create a Docbook file or a
transliteration to XML format.

   A Texinfo source file is a plain text file containing text
interspersed with "@-commands" (words preceded by an '@') that tell the
Texinfo processors what to do.  Texinfo's markup commands are almost
entirely "semantic"; that is, they specify the intended meaning of text
in the document, rather than physical formatting instructions.  You can
edit a Texinfo file with any text editor, but it is especially
convenient to use GNU Emacs since that editor has a special mode, called
Texinfo mode, that provides various Texinfo-related features.  (*Note
Texinfo Mode::.)

   Texinfo was devised specifically for the purpose of writing software
documentation and manuals.  If you want to write a good manual for your
program, Texinfo has many features which we hope will make your job
easier.  However, it provides almost no commands for controlling the
final formatting.  Texinfo is not intended to be a general-purpose
formatting program, so if you need to lay out a newspaper, devise a
glossy magazine ad, or follow the exact formatting requirements of a
publishing house, Texinfo may not be the simplest tool.

   Spell "Texinfo" with a capital "T" and the other letters in
lowercase.  The first syllable of "Texinfo" is pronounced like "speck",
not "hex".  This odd pronunciation is derived from the pronunciation of
TeX.  Pronounce TeX as if the 'X' were the last sound in the name
'Bach'.  In the word TeX, the 'X' is, rather than the English letter
"ex", actually the Greek letter "chi".

   Texinfo is the official documentation format of the GNU project.
More information, including manuals for GNU packages, is available at
the GNU documentation web page (http://www.gnu.org/doc/).

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Reporting Bugs,  Next: Output Formats,  Up: Overview

1.1 Reporting Bugs
==================

We welcome bug reports and suggestions for any aspect of the Texinfo
system: programs, documentation, installation, etc.  Please email them
to <bug-texinfo@gnu.org>.  You can get the latest version of Texinfo via
its home page, <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>.

   For bug reports, please include enough information for the
maintainers to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:

   * The version number of Texinfo and the program(s) or manual(s)
     involved.
   * The contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
   * Precisely how you ran any program(s) involved.
   * A description of the problem and samples of any erroneous output.
   * Hardware and operating system names and versions.
   * Anything else that you think would be helpful.

   When in doubt whether something is needed or not, include it.  It's
better to include too much than to leave out something important.

   It is critical to send an actual input file that reproduces the
problem.  What's not critical is to "narrow down" the example to the
smallest possible input--the actual input with which you discovered the
bug will suffice.  (Of course, if you do do experiments, the smaller the
input file, the better.)

   Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with
'diff -c' (*note (diffutils)Top::) and include 'ChangeLog' entries
(*note (emacs)Change Log::), and follow the existing coding style.

1.2 Output Formats
==================

Here is a brief overview of the output formats currently supported by
Texinfo.

Info
     (Generated via 'makeinfo'.)  Info format is mostly a plain text
     transliteration of the Texinfo source.  It adds a few control
     characters to provide navigational information for
     cross-references, indices, and so on.  The Emacs Info subsystem
     (*note (info)Top::), and the standalone 'info' program (*note
     (info-stnd)Top::), among others, can read these files.  *Note Info
     Files::, and *note Creating and Installing Info Files::.

Plain text
     (Generated via 'makeinfo --plaintext'.)  This is almost the same as
     Info output with the navigational control characters are omitted.

HTML
     (Generated via 'makeinfo --html'.)  HTML, standing for Hyper Text
     Markup Language, has become the most commonly used language for
     writing documents on the World Wide Web.  Web browsers, such as
     Mozilla, Lynx, and Emacs-W3, can render this language online.
     There are many versions of HTML, both different standards and
     browser-specific variations.  'makeinfo' tries to use a subset of
     the language that can be interpreted by any common browser,
     intentionally not using many newer or less widely-supported tags.
     Although the native output is thus rather plain, it can be
     customized at various levels, if desired.  For details of the HTML
     language and much related information, see
     <http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/>.  *Note Generating HTML::.

DVI
     (Generated via 'texi2dvi'.)  The DeVIce Independent binary format
     is output by the TeX typesetting program (<http://tug.org>).  This
     is then read by a DVI 'driver', which knows the actual
     device-specific commands that can be viewed or printed, notably
     Dvips for translation to PostScript (*note (dvips)Top::) and Xdvi
     for viewing on an X display
     (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdvi/>).  *Note Hardcopy::.  (Be
     aware that the Texinfo language is very different from and much
     stricter than TeX's usual languages: plain TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt,
     etc.)

PostScript
     (Generated via 'texi2dvi --ps'.)  PostScript is a page description
     language that became widely used around 1985 and is still used
     today.  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript> gives a basic
     description and more preferences.  By default, Texinfo uses the
     'dvips' program to convert TeX's DVI output to PostScript.  *Note
     (dvips)Top::.

PDF
     (Generated via 'texi2dvi --pdf' or 'texi2pdf'.)  This format was
     developed by Adobe Systems for portable document interchange, based
     on their previous PostScript language.  It can represent the exact
     appearance of a document, including fonts and graphics, and
     supporting arbitrary scaling.  It is intended to be
     platform-independent and easily viewable, among other design goals;
     <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format> and
     <http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb22-3/tb72beebe-pdf.pdf> have some
     background.  By default, Texinfo uses the 'pdftex' program, an
     extension of TeX, to output PDF; see
     <http://tug.org/applications/pdftex>.  *Note PDF Output::.

Docbook
     (Generated via 'makeinfo --docbook'.)  This is an XML-based format
     developed some years ago, primarily for technical documentation.
     It therefore bears some resemblance, in broad outline, to Texinfo.
     See <http://www.docbook.org>.  Various converters from Docbook _to_
     Texinfo have also been developed; see the Texinfo web pages.

XML
     (Generated via 'makeinfo --xml'.)  XML is a generic syntax
     specification usable for any sort of content (a reference is at
     <http://www.w3.org/XML>).  The 'makeinfo' XML output, unlike all
     the other output formats, is a transliteration of the Texinfo
     source rather than processed output.  That is, it translates the
     Texinfo markup commands into XML syntax, for further processing by
     XML tools.  The XML contains enough information to recreate the
     original content, except for syntactic constructs such as Texinfo
     macros and conditionals.  The Texinfo source distribution includes
     a utility script 'txixml2texi' to do that backward transformation.

     The details of the output syntax are defined in an XML DTD as
     usual, which is contained in a file 'texinfo.dtd' included in the
     Texinfo source distribution and available via the Texinfo web
     pages.  Texinfo XML files, and XML files in general, cannot be
     viewed in typical web browsers; they won't follow the DTD reference
     and as a result will simply report a (misleading) syntax error.

1.3 Info Files
==============

As mentioned above, Info format is mostly a plain text transliteration
of the Texinfo source, with the addition of a few control characters to
separate nodes and provide navigational information, so that
Info-reading programs can operate on it.

   Info files are nearly always created by processing a Texinfo source
document.  'makeinfo', also known as 'texi2any', is the principal
command that converts a Texinfo file into an Info file; *note Generic
Translator texi2any::.

   Generally, you enter an Info file through a node that by convention
is named 'Top'.  This node normally contains just a brief summary of the
file's purpose, and a large menu through which the rest of the file is
reached.  From this node, you can either traverse the file
systematically by going from node to node, or you can go to a specific
node listed in the main menu, or you can search the index menus and then
go directly to the node that has the information you want.
Alternatively, with the standalone Info program, you can specify
specific menu items on the command line (*note (info)Top::).

   If you want to read through an Info file in sequence, as if it were a
printed manual, you can hit <SPC> repeatedly, or you get the whole file
with the advanced Info command 'g *'.  (*Note Advanced Info commands:
(info)Advanced.)

   The 'dir' file in the 'info' directory serves as the departure point
for the whole Info system.  From it, you can reach the 'Top' nodes of
each of the documents in a complete Info system.

   If you wish to refer to an Info file via a URI, you can use the
(unofficial) syntax exemplified by the following.  This works with
Emacs/W3, for example:
     info:emacs#Dissociated%20Press
     info:///usr/info/emacs#Dissociated%20Press
     info://localhost/usr/info/emacs#Dissociated%20Press

   The 'info' program itself does not follow URIs of any kind.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Printed Books,  Next: Adding Output Formats,  Prev: Info Files,  Up: Overview

1.4 Printed Books
=================

A Texinfo file can be formatted and typeset as a printed book or manual.
To do this, you need TeX, a sophisticated typesetting program written by
Donald Knuth of Stanford University.

   A Texinfo-based book is similar to any other typeset, printed work:
it can have a title page, copyright page, table of contents, and
preface, as well as chapters, numbered or unnumbered sections and
subsections, page headers, cross-references, footnotes, and indices.

   TeX is a general purpose typesetting program.  Texinfo provides a
file 'texinfo.tex' that contains information (definitions or "macros")
that TeX uses when it typesets a Texinfo file.  ('texinfo.tex' tells TeX
how to convert the Texinfo @-commands to TeX commands, which TeX can
then process to create the typeset document.)  'texinfo.tex' contains
the specifications for printing a document.  You can get the latest
version of 'texinfo.tex' from the Texinfo home page,
<http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>.

   In the United States, documents are most often printed on 8.5 inch by
11 inch pages (216mm by 280mm); this is the default size.  But you can
also print for 7 inch by 9.25 inch pages (178mm by 235mm, the
'@smallbook' size; or on A4 or A5 size paper ('@afourpaper',
'@afivepaper').  *Note @smallbook::, and *note A4 Paper::.

   TeX is freely distributable.  It is written in a superset of Pascal
for literate programming called WEB and can be compiled either in Pascal
or (by using a conversion program that comes with the TeX distribution)
in C.

   TeX is very powerful and has a great many features.  Because a
Texinfo file must be able to present information both on a
character-only terminal in Info form and in a typeset book, the
formatting commands that Texinfo supports are necessarily limited.

   *Note Obtaining TeX::, for information on acquiring TeX.  It is not
part of the Texinfo distribution.

1.5 Adding Output Formats
=========================

The output formats in the previous sections handle a wide variety of
usage, but of course there is always room for more.

   If you are a programmer and would like to contribute to the GNU
project by implementing additional output formats for Texinfo, that
would be excellent.  The way to do this that would be most useful is to
write a new back-end for 'texi2any', our reference implementation of a
Texinfo parser; it creates a tree representation of the Texinfo input
that you can use for the conversion.  The documentation in the source
file 'tp/Texinfo/Convert/Converter.pm' is a good place to start.  *Note
Generic Translator texi2any::.

   Another viable approach is use the Texinfo XML output from 'texi2any'
as your input.  This XML is an essentially complete representation of
the input, but without the Texinfo syntax and option peculiarities, as
described above.

   If you still cannot resist the temptation of writing a new program
that reads Texinfo source directly, let us give some more caveats:
please do not underestimate the amount of work required.  Texinfo is by
no means a simple language to parse correctly, and remains under
development, so you would be committing to an ongoing task.  You are
advised to check that the tests of the language that come with
'texi2any' give correct results with your new program.

   From time to time, proposals are made to generate traditional Unix
man pages from Texinfo source.  However, because man pages have a strict
conventional format, creating a good man page requires a completely
different source from that needed for the typical Texinfo applications
of writing a good user tutorial and/or a good reference manual.  This
makes generating man pages incompatible with the Texinfo design goal of
not having to document the same information in different ways for
different output formats.  You might as well write the man page
directly.

   As an alternative way to support man pages, you may find the program
'help2man' to be useful.  It generates a traditional man page from the
'--help' output of a program.  In fact, the man pages for the programs
in the Texinfo distribution are generated with this.  It is GNU software
written by Brendan O'Dea, available from
<http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man>.

Richard M. Stallman invented the Texinfo format, wrote the initial
processors, and created Edition 1.0 of this manual.  Robert J. Chassell
greatly revised and extended the manual, starting with Edition 1.1.
Brian Fox was responsible for the standalone Texinfo distribution until
version 3.8, and originally wrote the standalone 'makeinfo' and 'info'
programs.  Karl Berry has continued maintenance since Texinfo 3.8
(manual edition 2.22).

   Our thanks go out to all who helped improve this work, particularly
the indefatigable Eli Zaretskii and Andreas Schwab, who have provided
patches beyond counting.  François Pinard and David D. Zuhn, tirelessly
recorded and reported mistakes and obscurities.  Zack Weinberg did the
impossible by implementing the macro syntax in 'texinfo.tex'.  Thanks to
Melissa Weisshaus for her frequent reviews of nearly similar editions.
Dozens of others have contributed patches and suggestions, they are
gratefully acknowledged in the 'ChangeLog' file.  Our mistakes are our
own.

Beginnings
----------

In the 1970's at CMU, Brian Reid developed a program and format named
Scribe to mark up documents for printing.  It used the '@' character to
introduce commands, as Texinfo does.  Much more consequentially, it
strove to describe document contents rather than formatting, an idea
wholeheartedly adopted by Texinfo.

   Meanwhile, people at MIT developed another, not too dissimilar format
called Bolio.  This then was converted to using TeX as its typesetting
language: BoTeX.  The earliest BoTeX version seems to have been 0.02 on
October 31, 1984.

   BoTeX could only be used as a markup language for documents to be
printed, not for online documents.  Richard Stallman (RMS) worked on
both Bolio and BoTeX.  He also developed a nifty on-line help format
called Info, and then combined BoTeX and Info to create Texinfo, a mark
up language for text that is intended to be read both online and as
printed hard copy.

   Moving forward, the original translator to create Info was written
(primarily by RMS and Bob Chassell) in Emacs Lisp, namely the
'texinfo-format-buffer' and other functions.  In the early 1990s, Brian
Fox reimplemented the conversion program in C, now called 'makeinfo'.

Reimplementing in Perl
----------------------

In 2012, the C 'makeinfo' was itself replaced by a Perl implementation
generically called 'texi2any'.  This version supports the same level of
output customization as 'texi2html', an independent program originally
written by Lionel Cons, later with substantial work by many others.  The
many additional features needed to make 'texi2html' a replacement for
'makeinfo' were implemented by Patrice Dumas.  The first never-released
version of 'texi2any' was based on the 'texi2html' code.  That
implementation, however, was abandoned in favor of the current program,
which parses the Texinfo input into a tree for processing.  It still
supports nearly all the features of 'texi2html'.

   The new Perl program is much slower than the old C program.  We hope
the speed gap will close in the future, but it may not ever be entirely
comparable.  So why did we switch?  In short, we intend and hope that
the present program will be much easier than the previous C
implementation of 'makeinfo' to extend to different output styles,
back-end output formats, and all other customizations.  In more detail:

   * HTML customization.  Many GNU and other free software packages had
     been happily using the HTML customization features in 'texi2html'
     for years.  Thus, in effect two independent implementations of the
     Texinfo language had developed, and keeping them in sync was not
     simple.  Adding the HTML customization possible in 'texi2html' to a
     C program would have been an enormous effort.

   * Unicode, and multilingual support generally, especially of east
     Asian languages.  Although of course it's perfectly plausible to
     write such support in C, in the particular case of 'makeinfo', it
     would have been tantamount to rewriting the entire program.  In
     Perl, much of that comes essentially for free.

   * Additional back-ends.  The 'makeinfo' code had become convoluted to
     the point where adding a new back-end was quite complex, requiring
     complex interactions with existing back-ends.  In contrast, our
     Perl implementation provides a clean tree-based representation for
     all back-ends to work from.  People have requested numerous
     different back-ends (LaTeX, the latest (X)HTML, ...), and they will
     now be much more feasible to implement.  Which leads to the last
     item:

   * Making contributions easier.  In general, due to the cleaner
     structure, the Perl program should be considerably easier than the
     C for anyone to read and contribute to, with the resulting obvious
     benefits.

   *Note Reference Implementation::, for more on the rationale for and
role of 'texi2any'.

2 Writing a Texinfo File
************************

This chapter describes Texinfo syntax and what is required in a Texinfo
file, and gives a short sample file.

* Menu:

* Conventions::                 General rules for writing a Texinfo file.
* Comments::                    Writing comments and ignored text in general.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Conventions,  Next: Comments,  Up: Writing a Texinfo File

2.1 General Syntactic Conventions
=================================

This section describes the general conventions used in all Texinfo
documents.

   * All printable ASCII characters except '@', '{' and '}' can appear
     in a Texinfo file and stand for themselves.  '@' is the escape
     character which introduces commands, while '{' and '}' are used to
     surround arguments to certain commands.  To put one of these
     special characters into the document, put an '@' character in front
     of it, like this: '@@', '@{', and '@}'.

   * In a Texinfo file, the commands you write to describe the contents
     of the manual are preceded by an '@' character; they are called
     "@-commands".  (The '@' in Texinfo has the same meaning that '\'
     has in plain TeX.)

     Depending on what they do or what arguments(1) they take, you need
     to write @-commands on lines of their own, or as part of sentences.
     As a general rule, a command requires braces if it mingles among
     other text; but it does not need braces if it is on a line of its
     own.  For more details of Texinfo command syntax, see *note Command
     Syntax::.

   * Whitespace following an @-command name is optional and (usually)
     ignored if present.  The exceptions are contexts when whitespace is
     significant, e.g., an '@example' environment.

   * Texinfo supports the usual quotation marks used in English and in
     other languages; see *note Inserting Quotation Marks::.

   * Use three hyphens in a row, '---', to produce a long dash--like
     this (called an "em dash"), used for punctuation in sentences.  Use
     two hyphens, '--', to produce a medium dash (called an "en dash"),
     used primarily for numeric ranges, as in "June 25-26".  Use a
     single hyphen, '-', to produce a standard hyphen used in compound
     words.  For display on the screen, Info reduces three hyphens to
     two and two hyphens to one (not transitively!).  Of course, any
     number of hyphens in the source remain as they are in literal
     contexts, such as '@code' and '@example'.

   * Form feed ('CTRL-l') characters in the input are handled as
     follows:

     PDF/DVI
          In normal text, treated as ending any open paragraph;
          essentially ignored between paragraphs.

     Info
          Output as-is between paragraphs (their most common use); in
          other contexts, they may be treated as regular spaces (and
          thus consolidated with surrounding whitespace).

     HTML
          Written as a numeric entity except contexts where spaces are
          ignored; for example, in '@footnote{ ^L foo}', the form feed
          is ignored.

     XML
          Keep them everywhere; in attributes, escaped as '\f'; also,
          '\' is escaped as '\\' and newline as '\n'.

     Docbook
          Completely removed, as they are not allowed.

     As you can see, because of these differing requirements of the
     output formats, it's not possible to use form feeds completely
     portably.

   * *Caution:* Last, do not use tab characters in a Texinfo file!
     (Except perhaps in verbatim modes.)  TeX uses variable-width fonts,
     which means that it is impractical at best to define a tab to work
     in all circumstances.  Consequently, TeX treats tabs like single
     spaces, and that is not what they look like in the source.
     Furthermore, 'makeinfo' does nothing special with tabs, and thus a
     tab character in your input file will usually have a different
     appearance in the output.

     To avoid this problem, Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs inserts multiple
     spaces when you press the <TAB> key.  Also, you can run 'untabify'
     in Emacs to convert tabs in a region to multiple spaces, or use the
     'unexpand' command from the shell.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The word "argument" comes from the way it is used in mathematics
and does not refer to a dispute between two people; it refers to the
information presented to the command.  According to the 'Oxford English
Dictionary', the word derives from the Latin for "to make clear, prove";
thus it came to mean 'the evidence offered as proof', which is to say,
'the information offered', which led to its mathematical meaning.  In
its other thread of derivation, the word came to mean 'to assert in a
manner against which others may make counter assertions', which led to
the meaning of 'argument' as a dispute.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Minimum,  Prev: Conventions,  Up: Writing a Texinfo File

2.2 Comments
============

You can write comments in a Texinfo file by using the '@comment'
command, which may be abbreviated to '@c'.  Such comments are for a
person looking at the Texinfo source file.  All the text on a line that
follows either '@comment' or '@c' is a comment; the rest of the line
does not appear in the visible output.  (To be precise, the character
after the '@c' or '@comment' must be something other than a dash or
alphanumeric, or it will be taken as part of the command.)

   Often, you can write the '@comment' or '@c' in the middle of a line,
and only the text that follows after the '@comment' or '@c' command does
not appear; but some commands, such as '@settitle', work on a whole
line.  You cannot use '@comment' or '@c' within a line beginning with
such a command.

   In cases of nested command invocations, complicated macro
definitions, etc., '@c' and '@comment' may provoke an error when
processing with TeX.  Therefore, you can also use the 'DEL' character
(ASCII 127 decimal, 0x7f hex, 0177 octal) as a true TeX comment
character (catcode 14, in TeX internals).  Everything on the line after
the 'DEL' will be ignored.

   You can also have long stretches of text ignored by the Texinfo
processors with the '@ignore' and '@end ignore' commands.  Write each of
these commands on a line of its own, starting each command at the
beginning of the line.  Text between these two commands does not appear
in the processed output.  You can use '@ignore' and '@end ignore' for
writing comments.  (For some caveats regarding nesting of such commands,
*note Conditional Nesting::.)

2.3 What a Texinfo File Must Have
=================================

By convention, the name of a Texinfo file ends with one of the
extensions '.texi', '.texinfo', '.txi', or '.tex'.

   In order to be made into a printed manual and other output formats, a
Texinfo file must begin with lines like this:

     \input texinfo
     @settitle NAME-OF-MANUAL

The contents of the file follow this beginning, and then you must end
the Texinfo source with a line like this:

     @bye

Here's an explanation:

   * The '\input texinfo' line tells TeX to use the 'texinfo.tex' file,
     which tells TeX how to translate the Texinfo @-commands into TeX
     typesetting commands.  (Note the use of the backslash, '\'; this is
     correct for TeX.)

   * The '@settitle' line specifies a title for the page headers (or
     footers) of the printed manual, and the default title and document
     description for the '<head>' in HTML.  Strictly speaking,
     '@settitle' is optional--if you don't mind your document being
     titled 'Untitled'.

   * The '@bye' line at the end of the file on a line of its own tells
     the formatters that the file is ended and to stop formatting.  If
     you leave this out, you'll be dumped at TeX's prompt at the end of
     the run.

   Furthermore, you will usually provide a Texinfo file with a title
page, indices, and the like, all of which are explained in this manual.
But the minimum, which can be useful for short documents, is just the
two lines at the beginning and the one line at the end.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Short Sample,  Prev: Minimum,  Up: Writing a Texinfo File

2.4 A Short Sample Texinfo File
===============================

Here is a short but complete Texinfo file, so you can see how Texinfo
source appears in practice.  The first three parts of the file are
mostly boilerplate: when writing a manual, you simply change the names
as appropriate.

   The complete file, without interspersed comments, is shown in *note
Short Sample Texinfo File::.

   *Note Beginning and Ending a File::, for more documentation on the
commands listed here.

Header
------

The header tells TeX which definitions file to use, names the manual,
and carries out other such housekeeping tasks.

     \input texinfo
     @settitle Sample Manual 1.0

Summary Description and Copyright
---------------------------------

This segment describes the document and contains the copyright notice
and copying permissions.  This is done with the '@copying' command.

A real manual includes more text here, according to the license under
which it is distributed.  *Note GNU Sample Texts::.

     @copying
     This is a short example of a complete Texinfo file, version 1.0.

     Copyright @copyright{} 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     @end copying

Titlepage, Copyright, Contents
------------------------------

The title and copyright segment contains the title and copyright pages
for the printed manual.  The segment must be enclosed between
'@titlepage' and '@end titlepage' commands.  The title and copyright
page does not appear in the online output.

We use the '@insertcopying' command to include the permission text from
the previous section, instead of writing it out again; it is output on
the back of the title page.  The '@contents' command generates a table
of contents.

     @titlepage
     @title Sample Title

     @c The following two commands start the copyright page.
     @page
     @vskip 0pt plus 1filll
     @insertcopying
     @end titlepage

     @c Output the table of contents at the beginning.
     @contents

'Top' Node and Master Menu
--------------------------

The 'Top' node starts off the online output; it does not appear in the
printed manual.  We repeat the short description from the beginning of
the '@copying' text, but there's no need to repeat the copyright
information, so we don't use '@insertcopying' here.

   The '@top' command itself helps 'makeinfo' determine the
relationships between nodes.  The 'Top' node contains at least a
top-level "menu" listing the chapters, and possibly a "Master Menu"
listing all the nodes in the entire document.

     @ifnottex
     @node Top
     @top Short Sample

     This is a short sample Texinfo file.
     @end ifnottex

     @menu
     * First Chapter::    The first chapter is the
                            only chapter in this sample.
     * Index::            Complete index.
     @end menu

The Body of the Document
------------------------

The body segment contains all the text of the document, but not the
indices or table of contents.  This example illustrates a node and a
chapter containing an enumerated list.

     @node First Chapter
     @chapter First Chapter

     @cindex chapter, first

     This is the first chapter.
     @cindex index entry, another

     Here is a numbered list.

     @enumerate
     @item
     This is the first item.

     @item
     This is the second item.
     @end enumerate

The End of the Document
-----------------------

This may contain commands for printing indices, and closes with the
'@bye' command, which marks the end of the document.

     @node Index
     @unnumbered Index

     @printindex cp

     @bye

Some Results
------------

Here is what the contents of the first chapter of the sample look like:


     This is the first chapter.

     Here is a numbered list.

       1. This is the first item.

       2. This is the second item.

3 Beginning and Ending a Texinfo File
*************************************

This chapter expands on the minimal complete Texinfo source file
previously given (*note Short Sample::).

   Certain pieces of information must be provided at the beginning of a
Texinfo file, such as the title of the document and the Top node.  A
table of contents is also generally produced here.

   Straight text outside of any command before the Top node should be
avoided.  Such text is treated differently in the different output
formats: at the time of writing, it is visible in TeX and HTML, by
default not shown in Info readers, and so on.

* Menu:

* Sample Beginning::            A sample beginning for a Texinfo file.
* Texinfo File Header::         The first lines.
* Document Permissions::        Ensuring your manual is free.
* Titlepage & Copyright Page::  Creating the title and copyright pages.
* Contents::                    How to create a table of contents.

3.2 Texinfo File Header
=======================

Texinfo files start with at least two lines.  These are the '\input
texinfo' line and the '@settitle' line.

   Also, if you want to format just part of the Texinfo file in Emacs,
you must write the '@settitle' line between start-of-header and
end-of-header lines.  These start- and end-of-header lines are optional,
but they do no harm, so you might as well always include them.

   Any command that affects document formatting as a whole makes sense
to include in the header.  '@synindex' (*note @synindex::), for
instance, is another command often included in the header.

   Thus, the beginning of a Texinfo file looks approximately like this:

     \input texinfo
     @settitle Sample Manual 1.0

   (*Note GNU Sample Texts:: for complete sample texts.)

* Menu:

* First Line::                  The first line of a Texinfo file.
* Start of Header::             Formatting a region requires this.
* @setfilename::                Tell Info the name of the Info file.
* @settitle::                   Create a title for the printed work.
* End of Header::               Formatting a region requires this.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: First Line,  Next: Start of Header,  Up: Texinfo File Header

3.2.1 The First Line of a Texinfo File
--------------------------------------

Every Texinfo file that is to be the top-level input to TeX must begin
with a line that looks like this:

     \input texinfo

   When the file is processed by TeX, the '\input texinfo' command tells
TeX to load the macros needed for processing a Texinfo file.  These are
in a file called 'texinfo.tex', which should have been installed on your
system along with either the TeX or Texinfo software.  TeX uses the
backslash, '\', to mark the beginning of a command, exactly as Texinfo
uses '@'.  The 'texinfo.tex' file causes the switch from '\' to '@';
before the switch occurs, TeX requires '\', which is why it appears at
the beginning of the file.

   You may optionally follow this line with a comment to tell GNU Emacs
to use Texinfo mode when the file is edited:

     \input texinfo   @c -*-texinfo-*-

This may be useful when Emacs doesn't detect the file type from the file
extension automatically.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Start of Header,  Next: @setfilename,  Prev: First Line,  Up: Texinfo File Header

3.2.2 Start of Header
---------------------

A start-of-header line is a Texinfo comment that looks like this:

     @c %**start of header

   Write the start-of-header line on the second line of a Texinfo file.
Follow the start-of-header line with an '@settitle' line and,
optionally, with other commands that globally affect the document
formatting, such as '@synindex' or '@footnotestyle'; and then by an
end-of-header line (*note End of Header::).

   The start- and end-of-header lines allow you to format only part of a
Texinfo file for Info or printing.  *Note texinfo-format commands::.

   The odd string of characters, '%**', is to ensure that no other
comment is accidentally taken for a start-of-header line.  You can
change it if you wish by setting the 'tex-start-of-header' and/or
'tex-end-of-header' Emacs variables.  *Note Texinfo Mode Printing::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @setfilename,  Next: @settitle,  Prev: Start of Header,  Up: Texinfo File Header

3.2.3 '@setfilename': Set the Output File Name
----------------------------------------------

The '@setfilename' line specifies the name of the output file to be
generated.  When present, it should be the first Texinfo command (that
is, after '\input texinfo').  Write the '@setfilename' command at the
beginning of a line and follow it on the same line by the Info file
name.

     @setfilename INFO-FILE-NAME

   The name must be different from the name of the Texinfo file.  There
are two conventions for choosing the name: you can either remove the
extension (such as '.texi') entirely from the input file name, or
(recommended) replace it with the '.info' extension.

   When a '@setfilename' line is present, the Texinfo processors ignore
everything written before the '@setfilename' line.  This is why the very
first line of the file (the '\input' line) does not show up in the
output.

   If there is no '@setfilename' line, 'makeinfo' uses the input file
name to determine the output name: first, any of the extensions '.texi',
'.tex', '.txi' or '.texinfo' is removed from the input file name; then,
the output format specific extension is added--'.html' when generating
HTML, '.info' when generating Info, etc.  The '\input' line is still
ignored in this processing, as well as leading blank lines.

   When producing another output format, 'makeinfo' will replace any
final extension with the output format-specific extension ('html' when
generating HTML, for example), or add a dot followed by the extension
('.html' for HTML) if the given name has no extension.

   '@setfilename' used to be required by the Texinfo processors, and
some other programs may still expect it to be present; for example,
Automake (*note (automake)Texinfo::).

   Although an explicit '.info' extension is preferable, some operating
systems cannot handle long file names.  You can run into a problem even
when the file name you specify is itself short enough.  This occurs
because the Info formatters split a long Info file into short indirect
subfiles, and name them by appending '-1', '-2', ..., '-10', '-11', and
so on, to the original file name.  (*Note Tag and Split Files::.)  The
subfile name 'texinfo.info-10', for example, is too long for old systems
with a 14-character limit on filenames; so the Info file name for this
document is 'texinfo' rather than 'texinfo.info'.  When 'makeinfo' is
running on operating systems such as MS-DOS which impose severe limits
on file names, it may remove some characters from the original file name
to leave enough space for the subfile suffix, thus producing files named
'texin-10', 'gcc.i12', etc.

   See also the '--output' option in *note Invoking texi2any::.

3.2.4 '@settitle': Set the Document Title
-----------------------------------------

A Texinfo file should contain a line that looks like this:

     @settitle TITLE

   Write the '@settitle' command at the beginning of a line and follow
it on the same line by the title.  Do not write anything else on the
line.  The '@settitle' command should precede everything that generates
actual output.  The best place for it is right after the '@setfilename'
command (described in the previous section).

   This command tells TeX the title to use in a header or footer for
double-sided output, in case such headings are output.  For more on
headings for TeX, see *note Heading Generation::.

   In the HTML file produced by 'makeinfo', TITLE serves as the document
'<title>'.  It also becomes the default document description in the
'<head>' part (*note @documentdescription::).

   When the title page is used in the output, the title in the
'@settitle' command does not affect the title as it appears on the title
page.  Thus, the two do not need not to match exactly.  A practice we
recommend is to include the version or edition number of the manual in
the '@settitle' title; on the title page, the version number generally
appears as a '@subtitle' so it would be omitted from the '@title'.
*Note @titlepage::.

3.2.5 End of Header
-------------------

Follow the header lines with an end-of-header line, which is a Texinfo
comment that looks like this:

3.3 Document Permissions
========================

The copyright notice and copying permissions for a document need to
appear in several places in the various Texinfo output formats.
Therefore, Texinfo provides a command ('@copying') to declare this text
once, and another command ('@insertcopying') to insert the text at
appropriate points.

   This section is about the license of the Texinfo document.  If the
document is a software manual, the software is typically under a
different license--for GNU and many other free software packages,
software is usually released under the GNU GPL, and manuals are released
under the GNU FDL.  It is helpful to state the license of the software
of the manual, but giving the complete text of the software license is
not necessarily required.

* Menu:

* @copying::                    Declare the document's copying permissions.
* @insertcopying::              Where to insert the permissions.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @copying,  Next: @insertcopying,  Up: Document Permissions

3.3.1 '@copying': Declare Copying Permissions
---------------------------------------------

The '@copying' command should be given very early in the document; the
recommended location is right after the header material (*note Texinfo
File Header::).  It conventionally consists of a sentence or two about
what the program is, identification of the documentation itself, the
legal copyright line, and the copying permissions.  Here is a skeletal
example:

     @copying
     This manual is for PROGRAM (version VERSION, updated
     DATE), which ...

     Copyright @copyright{} YEARS COPYRIGHT-OWNER.

     @quotation
     Permission is granted to ...
     @end quotation
     @end copying

   The '@quotation' has no legal significance; it's there to improve
readability in some contexts.

   The text of '@copying' is output as a comment at the beginning of
Info, HTML, XML, and Docbook output files.  It is _not_ output
implicitly in plain text or TeX; it's up to you to use '@insertcopying'
to emit the copying information.  See the next section for details.

   The '@copyright{}' command generates a 'c' inside a circle when the
output format supports this glyph (print and HTML always do, for
instance).  When the glyph is not supported in the output, it generates
the three-character sequence '(C)'.

   The copyright notice itself has the following legally-prescribed
form:

     Copyright (C) YEARS COPYRIGHT-OWNER.

   The word 'Copyright' must always be written in English, even if the
document is otherwise written in another language.  This is due to
international law.

   The list of years should include all years in which a version was
completed (even if it was released in a subsequent year).  It is
simplest for each year to be written out individually and in full,
separated by commas.

   The copyright owner (or owners) is whoever holds legal copyright on
the work.  In the case of works assigned to the FSF, the owner is 'Free
Software Foundation, Inc.'.

   The copyright 'line' may actually be split across multiple lines,
both in the source document and in the output.  This often happens for
documents with a long history, having many different years of
publication.  If you do use several lines, do not indent any of them (or
anything else in the '@copying' block) in the source file.

   *Note (maintain)Copyright Notices::, for additional information.
*Note GNU Sample Texts::, for the full text to be used in GNU manuals.
*Note GNU Free Documentation License::, for the license itself under
which GNU and other free manuals are distributed.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @insertcopying,  Prev: @copying,  Up: Document Permissions

3.3.2 '@insertcopying': Include Permissions Text
------------------------------------------------

The '@insertcopying' command is simply written on a line by itself, like
this:

     @insertcopying

   This inserts the text previously defined by '@copying'.  To meet
legal requirements, it must be used on the copyright page in the printed
manual (*note Copyright::).

   The '@copying' command itself causes the permissions text to appear
in an Info file _before_ the first node.  The text is also copied into
the beginning of each split Info output file, as is legally necessary.
This location implies a human reading the manual using Info does _not_
see this text (except when using the advanced Info command 'g *'), but
this does not matter for legal purposes, because the text is present.

   Similarly, the '@copying' text is automatically included at the
beginning of each HTML output file, as an HTML comment.  Again, this
text is not visible (unless the reader views the HTML source).

   The permissions text defined by '@copying' also appears automatically
at the beginning of the XML and Docbook output files.

3.4 Title and Copyright Pages
=============================

In hard copy output, the manual's name and author are usually printed on
a title page.  Copyright information is usually printed on the back of
the title page.

   The title and copyright pages appear in printed manuals, but not in
most other output formats.  Because of this, it is possible to use
several slightly obscure typesetting commands that are not to be used in
the main text.  In addition, this part of the beginning of a Texinfo
file contains the text of the copying permissions that appears in the
printed manual.

* Menu:

* @titlepage::                  Create a title for the printed document.
* @titlefont @center @sp::      The '@titlefont', '@center',
                                 and '@sp' commands.
* @title @subtitle @author::    The '@title', '@subtitle',
                                 and '@author' commands.
* Copyright::                   How to write the copyright notice and
                                 include copying permissions.
* Heading Generation::          Turn on page headings after the title and
                                 copyright pages.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @titlepage,  Next: @titlefont @center @sp,  Up: Titlepage & Copyright Page

3.4.1 '@titlepage'
------------------

Start the material for the title page and following copyright page with
'@titlepage' on a line by itself and end it with '@end titlepage' on a
line by itself.

   The '@end titlepage' command starts a new page and turns on page
numbering (*note Heading Generation::).  All the material that you want
to appear on unnumbered pages should be put between the '@titlepage' and
'@end titlepage' commands.

   By using the '@page' command you can force a page break within the
region delineated by the '@titlepage' and '@end titlepage' commands and
thereby create more than one unnumbered page.  This is how the copyright
page is produced.  (The '@titlepage' command might perhaps have been
better named the '@titleandadditionalpages' command, but that would have
been rather long!)

   When you write a manual about a computer program, you should write
the version of the program to which the manual applies on the title
page.  If the manual changes more frequently than the program or is
independent of it, you should also include an edition number(1) for the
manual.  This helps readers keep track of which manual is for which
version of the program.  (The 'Top' node should also contain this
information; see *note The Top Node::.)

   Texinfo provides two main methods for creating a title page.  One
method uses the '@titlefont', '@sp', and '@center' commands to generate
a title page in which the words on the page are centered.

   The second method uses the '@title', '@subtitle', and '@author'
commands to create a title page with black rules under the title and
author lines and the subtitle text set flush to the right hand side of
the page.  With this method, you do not specify any of the actual
formatting of the title page.  You specify the text you want, and
Texinfo does the formatting.

   You may use either method, or you may combine them; see the examples
in the sections below.

   For sufficiently simple documents, and for the bastard title page in
traditional book frontmatter, Texinfo also provides a command
'@shorttitlepage' which takes the rest of the line as the title.  The
argument is typeset on a page by itself and followed by a blank page.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) We have found that it is helpful to refer to versions of
independent manuals as 'editions' and versions of programs as
'versions'; otherwise, we find we are liable to confuse each other in
conversation by referring to both the documentation and the software
with the same words.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @titlefont @center @sp,  Next: @title @subtitle @author,  Prev: @titlepage,  Up: Titlepage & Copyright Page

3.4.2 '@titlefont', '@center', and '@sp'
----------------------------------------

You can use the '@titlefont', '@sp', and '@center' commands to create a
title page for a printed document.  (This is the first of the two
methods for creating a title page in Texinfo.)

   Use the '@titlefont' command to select a large font suitable for the
title itself.  You can use '@titlefont' more than once if you have an
especially long title.

   For HTML output, each '@titlefont' command produces an '<h1>'
heading, but the HTML document '<title>' is not affected.  For that, you
must put a '@settitle' command before the '@titlefont' command (*note
@settitle::).

   For example:

     @titlefont{Texinfo}

   Use the '@center' command at the beginning of a line to center the
remaining text on that line.  Thus,

     @center @titlefont{Texinfo}

centers the title, which in this example is "Texinfo" printed in the
title font.

   Use the '@sp' command to insert vertical space.  For example:

     @sp 2

This inserts two blank lines on the printed page.  (*Note @sp::, for
more information about the '@sp' command.)

   A template for this method looks like this:

     @titlepage
     @sp 10
     @center @titlefont{NAME-OF-MANUAL-WHEN-PRINTED}
     @sp 2
     @center SUBTITLE-IF-ANY
     @sp 2
     @center AUTHOR
     ...
     @end titlepage

   The spacing of the example fits an 8.5 by 11 inch manual.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @title @subtitle @author,  Next: Copyright,  Prev: @titlefont @center @sp,  Up: Titlepage & Copyright Page

3.4.3 '@title', '@subtitle', and '@author'
------------------------------------------

You can use the '@title', '@subtitle', and '@author' commands to create
a title page in which the vertical and horizontal spacing is done for
you automatically.  This contrasts with the method described in the
previous section, in which the '@sp' command is needed to adjust
vertical spacing.

   Write the '@title', '@subtitle', or '@author' commands at the
beginning of a line followed by the title, subtitle, or author.  The
'@author' command may be used for a quotation in an '@quotation' block
(*note @quotation::); except for that, it is an error to use any of
these commands outside of '@titlepage'.

   The '@title' command produces a line in which the title is set flush
to the left-hand side of the page in a larger than normal font.  The
title is underlined with a black rule.  The title must be given on a
single line in the source file; it will be broken into multiple lines of
output is needed.

   For long titles, the '@*' command may be used to specify the line
breaks in long titles if the automatic breaks do not suit.  Such
explicit line breaks are generally reflected in all output formats; if
you only want to specify them for the printed output, use a conditional
(*note Conditionals::).  For example:

     @title This Long Title@inlinefmt{tex,@*} Is Broken in @TeX{}

   The '@subtitle' command sets subtitles in a normal-sized font flush
to the right-hand side of the page.

   The '@author' command sets the names of the author or authors in a
middle-sized font flush to the left-hand side of the page on a line near
the bottom of the title page.  The names are followed by a black rule
that is thinner than the rule that underlines the title.

   There are two ways to use the '@author' command: you can write the
name or names on the remaining part of the line that starts with an
'@author' command:

     @author by Jane Smith and John Doe

or you can write the names one above each other by using multiple
'@author' commands:

     @author Jane Smith
     @author John Doe

   A template for this method looks like this:

     @titlepage
     @title NAME-OF-MANUAL-WHEN-PRINTED
     @subtitle SUBTITLE-IF-ANY
     @subtitle SECOND-SUBTITLE
     @author AUTHOR
     @page
     ...
     @end titlepage


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Copyright,  Next: Heading Generation,  Prev: @title @subtitle @author,  Up: Titlepage & Copyright Page

3.4.4 Copyright Page
--------------------

By international treaty, the copyright notice for a book must be either
on the title page or on the back of the title page.  When the copyright
notice is on the back of the title page, that page is customarily not
numbered.  Therefore, in Texinfo, the information on the copyright page
should be within '@titlepage' and '@end titlepage' commands.

   Use the '@page' command to cause a page break.  To push the copyright
notice and the other text on the copyright page towards the bottom of
the page, use the following incantation after '@page':

     @vskip 0pt plus 1filll

The '@vskip' command inserts whitespace in the TeX output; it is ignored
in all other output formats.  The '0pt plus 1filll' means to put in zero
points of mandatory whitespace, and as much optional whitespace as
needed to push the following text to the bottom of the page.  Note the
use of three 'l's in the word 'filll'; this is correct.

   To insert the copyright text itself, write '@insertcopying' next
(*note Document Permissions::):

     @insertcopying

   Follow the copying text by the publisher, ISBN numbers, cover art
credits, and other such information.

   Here is an example putting all this together:

     @titlepage
     ...
     @page
     @vskip 0pt plus 1filll
     @insertcopying

     Published by ...

     Cover art by ...
     @end titlepage

   We have one more special case to consider: for plain text output, you
must insert the copyright information explicitly if you want it to
appear.  For instance, you could have the following after the copyright
page:

     @ifplaintext
     @insertcopying
     @end ifplaintext

   You could include other title-like information for the plain text
output in the same place.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Heading Generation,  Prev: Copyright,  Up: Titlepage & Copyright Page

3.4.5 Heading Generation
------------------------

Like all '@end' commands (*note Quotations and Examples::), the '@end
titlepage' command must be written at the beginning of a line by itself,
with only one space between the '@end' and the 'titlepage'.  It not only
marks the end of the title and copyright pages, but also causes TeX to
start generating page headings and page numbers.

   Texinfo has two standard page heading formats, one for documents
printed on one side of each sheet of paper (single-sided printing), and
the other for documents printed on both sides of each sheet
(double-sided printing).

   In full generality, you can control the headings in different ways:

   * The conventional way is to write a '@setchapternewpage' command
     before the title page commands, if required, and then have the
     '@end titlepage' command start generating page headings in the
     manner desired.

     Most documents are formatted with the standard single-sided or
     double-sided headings, (sometimes) using '@setchapternewpage odd'
     for double-sided printing and (almost always) no
     '@setchapternewpage' command for single-sided printing (*note
     @setchapternewpage::).

   * Alternatively, you can use the '@headings' command to prevent page
     headings from being generated or to start them for either single or
     double-sided printing.  Write a '@headings' command immediately
     after the '@end titlepage' command.  To turn off headings, write
     '@headings off'.  *Note @headings::.

   * Or, you may specify your own page heading and footing format.
     *Note Headings::.

3.5 Generating a Table of Contents
==================================

The '@chapter', '@section', and other structuring commands (*note
Chapter Structuring::) supply the information to make up a table of
contents, but they do not cause an actual table to appear in the manual.
To do this, you must use the '@contents' and/or '@summarycontents'
command(s).

'@contents'
     Generates a table of contents in a printed manual, including all
     chapters, sections, subsections, etc., as well as appendices and
     unnumbered chapters.  Headings generated by '@majorheading',
     '@chapheading', and the other '@...heading' commands do not appear
     in the table of contents (*note Structuring Command Types::).

'@shortcontents'
'@summarycontents'
     ('@summarycontents' is a synonym for '@shortcontents'.)

     Generates a short or summary table of contents that lists only the
     chapters, appendices, and unnumbered chapters.  Sections,
     subsections and subsubsections are omitted.  Only a long manual
     needs a short table of contents in addition to the full table of
     contents.

   Both contents commands should be written on a line by themselves, and
placed near the beginning of the file, after the '@end titlepage' (*note
@titlepage::), before any sectioning command.  The contents commands
automatically generate a chapter-like heading at the top of the first
table of contents page, so don't include any sectioning command such as
'@unnumbered' before them.

   Since an Info file uses menus instead of tables of contents, the Info
formatting commands ignore the contents commands.  But the contents are
included in plain text output (generated by 'makeinfo --plaintext') and
in other output formats, such as HTML.

   When 'makeinfo' writes a short table of contents while producing HTML
output, the links in the short table of contents point to corresponding
entries in the full table of contents rather than the text of the
document.  The links in the full table of contents point to the main
text of the document.

3.6 The 'Top' Node and Master Menu
==================================

The 'Top' node is the node in which a reader enters an Info manual.  As
such, it should begin with a brief description of the manual (including
the version number), and end with a master menu for the whole manual.
Of course you should include any other general information you feel a
reader would find helpful.

   It is conventional and desirable to write a '@top' sectioning command
line containing the title of the document immediately after the '@node
Top' line (*note @top Command::).

   The contents of the 'Top' node should appear only in the online
output; none of it should appear in printed output, so enclose it
between '@ifnottex' and '@end ifnottex' commands.  (TeX does not print
either an '@node' line or a menu; they appear only in Info; strictly
speaking, you are not required to enclose these parts between
'@ifnottex' and '@end ifnottex', but it is simplest to do so.  *Note
Conditionally Visible Text: Conditionals.)

* Menu:

* Top Node Example::
* Master Menu Parts::

3.6.1 Top Node Example
----------------------

Here is an example of a Top node.

     Additional general information.

     @menu

     * Second Chapter::
     ...
     * Index::
     @end menu


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Master Menu Parts,  Prev: Top Node Example,  Up: The Top Node

3.6.2 Parts of a Master Menu
----------------------------

A "master menu" is the main menu.  It is customary to include a detailed
menu listing all the nodes in the document in this menu.

   Like any other menu, a master menu is enclosed in '@menu' and '@end
menu' and does not appear in the printed output.

   Generally, a master menu is divided into parts.

   * The first part contains the major nodes in the Texinfo file: the
     nodes for the chapters, chapter-like sections, and the appendices.

   * The second part contains nodes for the indices.

   * The third and subsequent parts contain a listing of the other,
     lower-level nodes, often ordered by chapter.  This way, rather than
     go through an intermediary menu, an inquirer can go directly to a
     particular node when searching for specific information.  These
     menu items are not required; add them if you think they are a
     convenience.  If you do use them, put '@detailmenu' before the
     first one, and '@end detailmenu' after the last; otherwise,
     'makeinfo' will get confused.

   Each section in the menu can be introduced by a descriptive line.  So
long as the line does not begin with an asterisk, it will not be treated
as a menu entry.  (*Note Writing a Menu::, for more information.)

   For example, the master menu for this manual looks like the following
(but has many more entries):

     @menu
     * Copying Conditions::  Your rights.
     * Overview::            Texinfo in brief.
     ...
     * Command and Variable Index::
     * General Index::

     @detailmenu
     --- The Detailed Node Listing ---

     Overview of Texinfo

     * Reporting Bugs:: ...
     ...

     Beginning a Texinfo File

     * Sample Beginning:: ...
     ...
     @end detailmenu
     @end menu

3.7 Global Document Commands
============================

Besides the basic commands mentioned in the previous sections, here are
additional commands which affect the document as a whole.  They are
generally all given before the Top node, if they are given at all.

* Menu:

* @documentdescription::        Document summary for the HTML output.
* @setchapternewpage::          Start chapters on right-hand pages.
* @headings::                   An option for turning headings on and off
                                        and double or single sided printing.
* @paragraphindent::            Specify paragraph indentation.
* @firstparagraphindent::       Suppressing first paragraph indentation.
* @exampleindent::              Specify environment indentation.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @documentdescription,  Next: @setchapternewpage,  Up: Global Document Commands

3.7.1 '@documentdescription': Summary Text
------------------------------------------

When producing HTML output for a document, 'makeinfo' writes a '<meta>'
element in the '<head>' to give some idea of the content of the
document.  By default, this "description" is the title of the document,
taken from the '@settitle' command (*note @settitle::).  To change this,
use the '@documentdescription' environment, as in:

     @documentdescription
     descriptive text.
     @end documentdescription

This will produce the following output in the '<head>' of the HTML:

     <meta name=description content="descriptive text.">

   '@documentdescription' must be specified before the first node of the
document.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @setchapternewpage,  Next: @headings,  Prev: @documentdescription,  Up: Global Document Commands

3.7.2 '@setchapternewpage': Blank Pages Before Chapters
-------------------------------------------------------

In an officially bound book, text is usually printed on both sides of
the paper, chapters start on right-hand pages, and right-hand pages have
odd numbers.  But in short reports, text often is printed only on one
side of the paper.  Also in short reports, chapters sometimes do not
start on new pages, but are printed on the same page as the end of the
preceding chapter, after a small amount of vertical whitespace.

   You can use the '@setchapternewpage' command with various arguments
to specify how TeX should start chapters and whether it should format
headers for printing on one or both sides of the paper (single-sided or
double-sided printing).

   Write the '@setchapternewpage' command at the beginning of a line
followed by its argument.

   For example, you would write the following to cause each chapter to
start on a fresh odd-numbered page:

     @setchapternewpage odd

   You can specify one of three alternatives with the
'@setchapternewpage' command:

'@setchapternewpage off'
     Cause TeX to typeset a new chapter on the same page as the last
     chapter, after skipping some vertical whitespace.  Also, cause TeX
     to format page headers for single-sided printing.

'@setchapternewpage on'
     Cause TeX to start new chapters on new pages and to format page
     headers for single-sided printing.  This is the form most often
     used for short reports or personal printing.  This is the default.

'@setchapternewpage odd'
     Cause TeX to start new chapters on new, odd-numbered pages
     (right-handed pages) and to typeset for double-sided printing.
     This is the form most often used for books and manuals.

   Texinfo does not have a '@setchapternewpage even' command, because
there is no printing tradition of starting chapters or books on an
even-numbered page.

   If you don't like the default headers that '@setchapternewpage' sets,
you can explicit control them with the '@headings' command.  *Note
@headings::.

   At the beginning of a manual or book, pages are not numbered--for
example, the title and copyright pages of a book are not numbered.  By
convention, table of contents and frontmatter pages are numbered with
roman numerals and not in sequence with the rest of the document.

   The '@setchapternewpage' has no effect in output formats that do not
have pages, such as Info and HTML.

   We recommend not including any '@setchapternewpage' command in your
document source at all, since such desired pagination is not intrinsic
to the document.  For a particular hard copy run, if you don't want the
default output (no blank pages, same headers on all pages) use the
'--texinfo' option to 'texi2dvi' to specify the output you want.

3.7.3 The '@headings' Command
-----------------------------

The '@headings' command is rarely used.  It specifies what kind of page
headings and footings to print on each page.  Usually, this is
controlled by the '@setchapternewpage' command.  You need the
'@headings' command only if the '@setchapternewpage' command does not do
what you want, or if you want to turn off predefined page headings prior
to defining your own.  Write a '@headings' command immediately after the
'@end titlepage' command.

   You can use '@headings' as follows:

'@headings off'
     Turn off printing of page headings.

'@headings single'
     Turn on page headings appropriate for single-sided printing.

'@headings double'
     Turn on page headings appropriate for double-sided printing.

'@headings singleafter'
'@headings doubleafter'
     Turn on 'single' or 'double' headings, respectively, after the
     current page is output.

'@headings on'
     Turn on page headings: 'single' if '@setchapternewpage on',
     'double' otherwise.

   For example, suppose you write '@setchapternewpage off' before the
'@titlepage' command to tell TeX to start a new chapter on the same page
as the end of the last chapter.  This command also causes TeX to typeset
page headers for single-sided printing.  To cause TeX to typeset for
double sided printing, write '@headings double' after the '@end
titlepage' command.

   You can stop TeX from generating any page headings at all by writing
'@headings off' on a line of its own immediately after the line
containing the '@end titlepage' command, like this:

     @end titlepage
     @headings off

The '@headings off' command overrides the '@end titlepage' command,
which would otherwise cause TeX to print page headings.

   You can also specify your own style of page heading and footing.

3.7.4 '@paragraphindent': Controlling Paragraph Indentation
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Texinfo processors may insert whitespace at the beginning of the
first line of each paragraph, thereby indenting that paragraph.  You can
use the '@paragraphindent' command to specify this indentation.  Write a
'@paragraphindent' command at the beginning of a line followed by either
'asis' or a number:

     @paragraphindent INDENT

   The indentation is according to the value of INDENT:

'asis'
     Do not change the existing indentation (not implemented in TeX).

'none'
0
     Omit all indentation.

N
     Indent by N space characters in Info output, by N ems in TeX.

   The default value of INDENT is 3.  '@paragraphindent' is ignored for
HTML output.

   It is best to write the '@paragraphindent' command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  *Note Start of
Header::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @firstparagraphindent,  Next: @exampleindent,  Prev: @paragraphindent,  Up: Global Document Commands

3.7.5 '@firstparagraphindent': Indenting After Headings
-------------------------------------------------------

As you can see in the present manual, the first paragraph in any section
is not indented by default.  Typographically, indentation is a paragraph
separator, which means that it is unnecessary when a new section begins.
This indentation is controlled with the '@firstparagraphindent' command:

     @firstparagraphindent WORD

   The first paragraph after a heading is indented according to the
value of WORD:

'none'
     Prevents the first paragraph from being indented (default).  This
     option is ignored by 'makeinfo' if '@paragraphindent asis' is in
     effect.

'insert'
     Include normal paragraph indentation.  This respects the paragraph
     indentation set by a '@paragraphindent' command (*note
     @paragraphindent::).

   '@firstparagraphindent' is ignored for HTML and Docbook output.

   It is best to write the '@firstparagraphindent' command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  *Note Start of
Header::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @exampleindent,  Prev: @firstparagraphindent,  Up: Global Document Commands

3.7.6 '@exampleindent': Environment Indenting
---------------------------------------------

The Texinfo processors indent each line of '@example' and similar
environments.  You can use the '@exampleindent' command to specify this
indentation.  Write an '@exampleindent' command at the beginning of a
line followed by either 'asis' or a number:

     @exampleindent INDENT

   The indentation is according to the value of INDENT:

'asis'
     Do not change the existing indentation (not implemented in TeX).

0
     Omit all indentation.

N
     Indent environments by N space characters in Info output, by N ems
     in TeX.

   The default value of INDENT is 5 spaces in Info, and 0.4in in TeX,
which is somewhat less.  (The reduction is to help TeX fit more
characters onto physical lines.)

   It is best to write the '@exampleindent' command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  *Note Start of
Header::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Ending a File,  Prev: Global Document Commands,  Up: Beginning and Ending a File

3.8 Ending a Texinfo File
=========================

The end of a Texinfo file should include commands to create indices
(*note Printing Indices & Menus::), and the '@bye' command to mark the
last line to be processed.  For example:

     @node Index
     @unnumbered Index

     @printindex cp

     @bye

   An '@bye' command terminates Texinfo processing.  None of the
formatters process anything following '@bye'; any such text is
completely ignored.  The '@bye' command should be on a line by itself.

   Thus, if you wish, you may follow the '@bye' line with arbitrary
notes.  Also, you may follow the '@bye' line with a local variables list
for Emacs, most typically a 'compile-command' (*note Using the Local
Variables List: Compile-Command.).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Nodes,  Next: Chapter Structuring,  Prev: Beginning and Ending a File,  Up: Top

4 Nodes
*******

A "node" is a region of text that begins at a '@node' command, and
continues until the next '@node' command.  To specify a node, write a
'@node' command at the beginning of a line, and follow it with the name
of the node.  Each node contains the discussion of one topic.  Info
readers display one node at a time, and provide commands for the user to
move to related nodes.  The HTML output can be similarly navigated.

   Nodes are used as the targets of cross-references.  Cross-references,
such as the one at the end of this sentence, are made with '@xref' and
related commands; see *note Cross References::.  Cross-references can be
sprinkled throughout the text, and provide a way to represent links that
do not fit a hierarchical structure.

   Normally, you put a node command immediately before each chapter
structuring command--for example, an '@section' or '@subsection' line.
(*Note Chapter Structuring::.).  You must do this even if you do not
intend to format the file for Info.  This is because TeX uses both
'@node' names and chapter-structuring names in the output for
cross-references.  The only time you are likely to use the chapter
structuring commands without also using nodes is if you are writing a
document that contains no cross references and will only be printed, not
transformed into Info, HTML, or other formats.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Texinfo Document Structure,  Next: Node Names,  Up: Nodes

4.1 Texinfo Document Structure
==============================

Nodes can contain "menus", which contain the names of "child nodes"
within the parent node; for example, a node corresponding to a chapter
would have a menu of the sections in that chapter.  The menus allow the
user to move to the child nodes in a natural way in the online output.

   In addition, nodes contain "node pointers" that name other nodes.
The 'Next' and 'Previous' pointers form nodes at the same sectioning
level into a chain.  As you might imagine, the 'Next' pointer links to
the next node, and the 'Previous' pointer links to the previous node.
Thus, for example, all the nodes that are at the level of sections
within a chapter are linked together, and the order in this chain is the
same as the order of the children in the menu of the parent chapter.
Each child node records the parent node name as its 'Up' pointer.

   The Info and HTML output from 'makeinfo' for each node includes links
to the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' nodes.  The HTML also uses the
'accesskey' attribute with the values 'n', 'p', and 'u' respectively.
This allows people using web browsers to follow the navigation using
(typically) 'M-LETTER', e.g., 'M-n' for the 'Next' node, from anywhere
within the node.  Node pointers and menus provide structure for Info
files just as chapters, sections, subsections, and the like provide
structure for printed books.  The two structures are theoretically
distinct; in practice, however, the tree structure of printed books is
essentially always used for the node and menu structure also, as this
leads to a document which is easiest to follow.  *Note Texinfo Document
Structure::.

   Typically, the sectioning structure and the node structure are
completely parallel, with one node for each chapter, section, etc., and
with the nodes following the same hierarchical arrangement as the
sectioning.  Thus, if a node is at the logical level of a chapter, its
child nodes are at the level of sections; similarly, the child nodes of
sections are at the level of subsections.

   Although it is technically possible to create Texinfo documents with
only one structure or the other, or for the two structures not to be
parallel, or for either the sectioning or node structure to be
abnormally formed, etc., this is _not at all recommended_.  To the best
of our knowledge, all the Texinfo manuals currently in general use do
follow the conventional parallel structure.

4.2 Choosing Node Names
=======================

The name of a node identifies the node.  For all the details of node
names, *note Node Line Requirements::).

   Here are some suggestions for node names:

   * Try to pick node names that are informative but short.

     In the Info file, the file name, node name, and pointer names are
     all inserted on one line, which may run into the right edge of the
     window.  (This does not cause a problem with Info, but is ugly.)

   * Try to pick node names that differ from each other near the
     beginnings of their names.  This way, it is easy to use automatic
     name completion in Info.

   * Conventionally, node names are capitalized in the same way as
     section and chapter titles.  In this manual, initial and
     significant words are capitalized; others are not.  In other
     manuals, just initial words and proper nouns are capitalized.
     Either way is fine; we recommend just being consistent.

   * In HTML output, any characters in the node name other than plain
     ASCII letters, numbers or spaces will be changed in the file name.
     (*Note HTML Xref Node Name Expansion::.)  This can make the URL's
     for the pages in your manual less user-friendly; for example in
     this manual the '@dots' node is output as '__0040dots.html'.

   Because node names are used in cross-references, it is not desirable
to casually change them once published.  Such name changes invalidate
references from other manuals, from mail archives, and so on.

   The pointers from a given node enable you to reach other nodes and
consist simply of the names of those nodes.  The pointers are usually
not specified explicitly, as 'makeinfo' can determine them (*note
makeinfo Pointer Creation::).

   Normally, a node's 'Up' pointer contains the name of the node whose
menu mentions that node.  The node's 'Next' pointer contains the name of
the node that follows the present node in that menu and its 'Previous'
pointer contains the name of the node that precedes it in that menu.
When a node's 'Previous' node is the same as its 'Up' node, both
pointers name the same node.

   Usually, the first node of a Texinfo file is the 'Top' node, and its
'Up' pointer points to the 'dir' file, which contains the main menu for
all of Info.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Writing a Node,  Next: Node Line Requirements,  Prev: Node Names,  Up: Nodes

4.3 Writing an '@node' Line
===========================

The easiest way to write an '@node' line is to write '@node' at the
beginning of a line and then the name of the node, like this:

     @node NODE-NAME

   After you have inserted an '@node' line, you should immediately write
an @-command for the chapter or section and insert its name.  Next (and
this is important!), put in several index entries.  Usually, you will
find at least two and often as many as four or five ways of referring to
the node in the index.  Use them all.  This will make it much easier for
people to find the node.

   If you wish, you can ignore '@node' lines altogether in your first
draft and then use the 'texinfo-insert-node-lines' command to create
'@node' lines for you.  However, we do not recommend this practice.  It
is better to name the node itself at the same time that you write a
segment so you can easily make cross-references.  Useful
cross-references are an especially important feature of a good Texinfo
manual.

   Even when you explicitly specify all pointers, you cannot write the
nodes in the Texinfo source file in an arbitrary order!  Because
formatters must process the file sequentially, irrespective of node
pointers, you must write the nodes in the order you wish them to appear
in the output.  For Info format one can imagine that the order may not
matter, but it matters for the other formats.

   You may optionally follow the node name argument to '@node' with up
to three optional arguments on the rest of the same line, separating the
arguments with commas.  These are the names of the 'Next', 'Previous',
and 'Up' pointers, in that order.  We recommend omitting them if your
Texinfo document is hierarchically organized, as virtually all are
(*note makeinfo Pointer Creation::).

   Any spaces before or after each name on the '@node' line are ignored.

   The template for a fully-written-out node line with 'Next',
'Previous', and 'Up' pointers looks like this:

     @node NODE-NAME, NEXT, PREVIOUS, UP

   The NODE-NAME argument must be present, but the others are optional.
If you wish to specify some but not others, just insert commas as
needed, as in: '@node mynode,,,uppernode'.  However, we recommend
leaving off all the pointers and letting 'makeinfo' determine them.

   If you are using GNU Emacs, you can use the update node commands
provided by Texinfo mode to insert the names of the pointers; or
(recommended), you can leave the pointers out of the Texinfo file and
let 'makeinfo' insert node pointers into the Info file it creates.
(*Note Texinfo Mode::, and *note makeinfo Pointer Creation::.)

   Alternatively, you can insert the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up'
pointers yourself.  If you do this, you may find it helpful to use the
Texinfo mode keyboard command 'C-c C-c n'.  This command inserts '@node'
and a comment line listing the names of the pointers in their proper
order.  The comment line helps you keep track of which arguments are for
which pointers.  This comment line is especially useful if you are not
familiar with Texinfo.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Node Line Requirements,  Next: First Node,  Prev: Writing a Node,  Up: Nodes

4.4 '@node' Line Requirements
=============================

Names used with '@node' have several requirements:

   * All the node names in a single Texinfo file must be unique.

     This means, for example, that if you end every chapter with a
     summary, you must name each summary node differently.  You cannot
     just call them all "Summary".  You may, however, duplicate the
     titles of chapters, sections, and the like.  Thus you can end each
     chapter with a section called "Summary", so long as the node names
     for those sections are all different.

   * Node names can contain @-commands.  The output is generally the
     natural result of the command; for example, using '@TeX{}' in a
     node name results in the TeX logo being output, as it would be in
     normal text.  Cross-references should use '@TeX{}' just as the node
     name does.

     For Info and HTML output, especially, it is necessary to expand
     commands to some sequence of plain characters; for instance,
     '@TeX{}' expands to the three letters 'TeX' in the Info node name.
     However, cross-references to the node should not take the
     "shortcut" of using 'TeX'; stick to the actual node name, commands
     and all.

     Some commands do not make sense in node names; for instance,
     environments (e.g., '@quotation'), commands that read a whole line
     as their argument (e.g., '@sp'), and plenty of others.

     For the complete list of commands that are allowed, and their
     expansion for HTML identifiers and file names, *note HTML Xref
     Command Expansion::.  The expansions for Info are generally given
     with main the description of the command.

     Prior to the Texinfo 5 release in 2013, this feature was supported
     in an ad hoc way (the '--commands-in-node-names' option to
     'makeinfo').  Now it is part of the language.

   * Unfortunately, you cannot reliably use periods, commas, or colons
     within a node name; these can confuse the Info reader.  Also, a
     node name may not start with a left parenthesis preceding a right
     parenthesis, as in '(not)allowed', since this syntax is used to
     specify an external manual.  (Perhaps these limitations will be
     removed some day.)

     'makeinfo' warns about such problematic usage in node names, menu
     items, and cross-references.  If you don't want to see the
     warnings, you can set the customization variable
     'INFO_SPECIAL_CHARS_WARNING' to '0' (*note Other Customization
     Variables::).

     Also, if you insist on using these characters in node names
     (accepting the resulting substandard Info output), in order not to
     confuse the Texinfo processors you must still escape those
     characters, by using either special insertions (*note Inserting a
     Comma::) or '@asis' (*note @asis::).  For example:

          @node foo@asis{::}bar

     As an example of avoiding the special characters, the following is
     a section title in this manual:

          @section @code{@@unnumbered}, @code{@@appendix}: ...

     But the corresponding node name lacks the commas and the subtitle:

          @node @unnumbered @appendix

   * Case is significant in node names.

   * Spaces before and after names on the '@node' line are ignored.
     Multiple whitespace characters "inside" a name are collapsed to a
     single space.  For example:

          @node foo bar
          @node  foo bar,
          @node foo bar ,
          @node foo  bar,
          @node  foo  bar ,

     all define the same node, namely 'foo bar'.  In menu entries, this
     is the name that should be used: no leading or trailing spaces, and
     a single internal space.  (For cross-references, the node name used
     in the Texinfo sources is automatically normalized in this way.)

   * The next/previous/up pointers on '@node' lines must be the names of
     nodes.  (It's recommended to leave out these explicit node pointer
     names, which automatically avoids any problem here; *note makeinfo
     Pointer Creation::.)


File: texinfo.info,  Node: First Node,  Next: @top Command,  Prev: Node Line Requirements,  Up: Nodes

4.5 The First Node
==================

The first node of a Texinfo file is the "Top" node, except in an
included file (*note Include Files::).  The Top node should contain a
short summary, copying permissions, and a master menu.  *Note The Top
Node::, for more information on the Top node contents and examples.

   Here is a description of the node pointers to be used in the Top
node:

   * The Top node (which must be named 'top' or 'Top') should have as
     its 'Up' node the name of a node in another file, where there is a
     menu that leads to this file.  Specify the file name in
     parentheses.

     Usually, all Info files are available through a single virtual Info
     tree, constructed from multiple directories.  In this case, use
     '(dir)' as the parent of the Top node; this specifies the top-level
     node in the 'dir' file, which contains the main menu for the Info
     system as a whole.  (Each directory with Info files is intended to
     contain a file named 'dir'.)

     That's fine for Info, but for HTML output, one might well want the
     Up link from the Top node to go to some specific place.  For
     example, for GNU the natural place would be
     <http://www.gnu.org/manual/> (a web page collecting links to most
     GNU manuals), better specified as just '/manual/' if the manual
     will be installed on 'www.gnu.org'.  This can be specified with the
     'TOP_NODE_UP_URL' customization variable (*note HTML Customization
     Variables::), as in

          $ makeinfo --html -c TOP_NODE_UP_URL=/manual/ ...

   * The 'Prev' node of the Top node is usually either omitted or also
     set to '(dir)'.  Either is fine.

   * The 'Next' node of the Top node should be the first chapter in your
     document.

   *Note Installing an Info File::, for more information about
installing an Info file in the 'info' directory.

   It is usually best to leave the pointers off entirely and let the
tools implicitly define them, with this simple result:

     @node Top


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @top Command,  Next: Node Menu Illustration,  Prev: First Node,  Up: Nodes

4.6 The '@top' Sectioning Command
=================================

The '@top' command is a special sectioning command that you should only
use after a '@node Top' line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.  The
'@top' command tells the 'makeinfo' formatter which node is to be used
as the root of the node tree.

   It produces the same sort of output as '@unnumbered' (*note
@unnumbered @appendix::).

   The '@top' node is conventionally wrapped in an '@ifnottex'
conditional so that it will not appear in TeX output (*note
Conditionals::).  Thus, in practice, a Top node usually looks like this:

     @ifnottex
     @node Top
     @top YOUR-MANUAL-TITLE

     VERY-HIGH-LEVEL-SUMMARY
     @end ifnottex

   '@top' is ignored when raising or lowering sections.  That is, it is
never lowered and nothing can be raised to it (*note Raise/lower
sections::).

4.7 Node and Menu Illustration
==============================

Here is a diagram that illustrates a Texinfo file with three chapters,
each of which contains two sections.

   The "root" is at the top of the diagram and the "leaves" are at the
bottom.  This is how such a diagram is drawn conventionally; it
illustrates an upside-down tree.  For this reason, the root node is
called the 'Top' node, and 'Up' node pointers carry you closer to the
root.

                              Top
                               |
             -------------------------------------
            |                  |                  |
         Chapter 1          Chapter 2          Chapter 3
            |                  |                  |
         --------           --------           --------
        |        |         |        |         |        |
     Section  Section   Section  Section   Section  Section
       1.1      1.2       2.1      2.2       3.1      3.2

   Using explicit pointers (not recommended, but shown for purposes of
the example), the fully-written command to start Chapter 2 would be
this:

     @node     Chapter 2,  Chapter 3, Chapter 1, Top
     @comment  node-name,  next,      previous,  up

This '@node' line says that the name of this node is "Chapter 2", the
name of the 'Next' node is "Chapter 3", the name of the 'Previous' node
is "Chapter 1", and the name of the 'Up' node is "Top".  You can (and
should) omit writing out these node names if your document is
hierarchically organized (*note makeinfo Pointer Creation::), but the
pointer relationships still obtain.

     Note: 'Next' and 'Previous' refer to nodes at the _same
     hierarchical level_ in the manual, not necessarily to the next node
     within the Texinfo file.  In the Texinfo file, the subsequent node
     may be at a lower level--a section-level node most often follows a
     chapter-level node, for example.  (The 'Top' node contains the
     exception to this rule.  Since the 'Top' node is the only node at
     that level, 'Next' refers to the first following node, which is
     almost always a chapter or chapter-level node.)

   To go to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 using Info, you need a menu inside
Chapter 2.  (*Note Menus::.)  You would write the menu just before the
beginning of Section 2.1, like this:

        @menu
        * Sect. 2.1::    Description of this section.
        * Sect. 2.2::    Description.
        @end menu

   Using explicit pointers, the node for Sect. 2.1 is written like this:

     @node     Sect. 2.1, Sect. 2.2, Chapter 2, Chapter 2
     @comment  node-name, next,      previous,  up

   In Info format, the 'Next' and 'Previous' pointers of a node usually
lead to other nodes at the same level--from chapter to chapter or from
section to section (sometimes, as shown, the 'Previous' pointer points
up); an 'Up' pointer usually leads to a node at the level above (closer
to the 'Top' node); and a 'Menu' leads to nodes at a level below (closer
to 'leaves').  (A cross-reference can point to a node at any level; see
*note Cross References::.)

   A '@node' command and a chapter structuring command are
conventionally used together, in that order, often followed by indexing
commands.  (As shown in the example above, you may follow the '@node'
line with a comment line, e.g., to show which pointer is which if
explicit pointers are used.)  The Texinfo processors use this construct
to determine the relationships between nodes and sectioning commands.

   Here is the beginning of the chapter in this manual called "Ending a
Texinfo File".  This shows an '@node' line followed by an '@chapter'
line, and then by indexing lines.

     @node Ending a File
     @chapter Ending a Texinfo File
     @cindex Ending a Texinfo file
     @cindex Texinfo file ending
     @cindex File ending

   An earlier version of the manual used explicit node pointers.  Here
is the beginning of the same chapter for that case.  This shows an
'@node' line followed by a comment line, a '@chapter' line, and then by
indexing lines.

     @node    Ending a File, Structuring, Beginning a File, Top
     @comment node-name,     next,        previous,         up
     @chapter Ending a Texinfo File
     @cindex Ending a Texinfo file
     ...

4.8 'makeinfo' Pointer Creation
===============================

The 'makeinfo' program can automatically determine node pointers for a
hierarchically organized document.  This implicit node pointer creation
feature in 'makeinfo' relieves you from the need to update menus and
pointers manually or with Texinfo mode commands.  (*Note Updating Nodes
and Menus::.)  We highly recommend taking advantage of this.

   To do so, write your '@node' lines with just the name of the node:

     @node My Node

You do not need to write out the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers.

   Then, you must write a sectioning command, such as '@chapter' or
'@section', on the line immediately following each truncated '@node'
line (except that comment lines may intervene).  This is where it
normally goes.

   Also, you must write the name of each node (except for the 'Top'
node) in a menu that is one or more hierarchical levels above the node's
level.

   Finally, you must follow the 'Top' '@node' line with a line beginning
with '@top' to mark the top-level node in the file.  *Note @top
Command::.

   If you use a detailed menu in your master menu (*note Master Menu
Parts::), mark it with the '@detailmenu ... @end detailmenu'
environment, or 'makeinfo' will get confused, typically about the last
and/or first node in the document.

   In most cases, you will want to take advantage of this feature and
not redundantly specify node pointers that the programs can determine.
However, Texinfo documents are not required to be organized
hierarchically or in fact to contain sectioning commands at all (for
example, if you never intend the document to be printed), so node
pointers may still be specified explicitly, in full generality.

4.9 Menus
=========

"Menus" contain pointers to subordinate nodes.  In online output, you
use menus to go to such nodes.  Menus have no effect in printed manuals
and do not appear in them.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Writing a Menu,  Next: Menu Example,  Up: Menus

4.9.1 Writing a Menu
--------------------

A menu consists of a '@menu' command on a line by itself, followed by
menu entry lines or menu comment lines, and then followed by an '@end
menu' command on a line by itself.

   A menu looks like this:

     @menu
     Larger Units of Text

     * Files::                       All about handling files.
     * Multiples: Buffers.           Multiple buffers; editing
                                      several files at once.
     @end menu

   In a menu, every line that begins with an '* ' is a "menu entry".
(Note the space after the asterisk.)

   A line that does not start with an '* ' may also appear in a menu.
Such a line is not a menu entry but rather a "menu comment" line that
appears in the Info file.  In the example above, the line 'Larger Units
of Text' is such a menu comment line; the two lines starting with '* '
are menu entries.

   Technically, menus can carry you to any node, regardless of the
structure of the document; even to nodes in a different Info file.
However, we do not recommend making use of this, because it is hard for
readers to follow.  Also, the 'makeinfo' implicit pointer creation
feature (*note makeinfo Pointer Creation::) and GNU Emacs Texinfo mode
updating commands work only to create menus of subordinate nodes in a
hierarchically structured document.  It is much better to use
cross-references to refer to arbitrary nodes.

   'makeinfo' can automatically generate menus in nodes for Info and
HTML output, based on the chapter structure of the document.  To specify
that you want it to do this, place the line '@validatemenus off' near
the beginning of the document.

   In Info, a user selects a node with the 'm' ('Info-menu') command.
The menu entry name is what the user types after the 'm' command.  In
the HTML output from 'makeinfo', the 'accesskey' attribute is used with
the values '1'...'9' for the first nine entries.  This allows people
using web browsers to follow the first menu entries using (typically)
'M-DIGIT', e.g., 'M-1' for the first entry.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Menu Example,  Next: Menu Location,  Prev: Writing a Menu,  Up: Menus

4.9.2 A Menu Example
--------------------

A menu looks like this in Texinfo:

     @menu
     * menu entry name: Node name.   A short description.
     * Node name::                   This form is preferred.
     @end menu

This produces:

     * menu:

     * menu entry name: Node name.   A short description.
     * Node name::                   This form is preferred.

   Here is an example as you might see it in a Texinfo file:

     @menu
     Larger Units of Text

     * Files::                       All about handling files.
     * Multiples: Buffers.           Multiple buffers; editing
                                      several files at once.
     @end menu

This produces:

     * menu:
     Larger Units of Text

     * Files::                       All about handling files.
     * Multiples: Buffers.           Multiple buffers; editing
                                      several files at once.

   In this example, the menu has two entries.  'Files' is both a menu
entry name and the name of the node referred to by that name.
'Multiples' is the menu entry name; it refers to the node named
'Buffers'.  The line 'Larger Units of Text' is a comment; it appears in
the menu, but is not an entry.

   Since no file name is specified with either 'Files' or 'Buffers',
they must be the names of nodes in the same Info file (*note Referring
to Other Info Files: Other Info Files.).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Menu Location,  Next: Menu Parts,  Prev: Menu Example,  Up: Menus

4.9.3 Menu Location
-------------------

There may be at most one menu in a node.  A menu is conventionally
located at the end of a node, without any regular text or additional
commands between the '@end menu' and the beginning of the next node.

   This convention is useful, since a reader who uses the menu could
easily miss any such text.  Also, any such post-menu text will be
considered part of the menu in Info output (which has no marker for the
end of a menu).  Thus, a line beginning with '* ' will likely be
incorrectly handled.

   It's usually best if a node with a menu does not contain much text.
If you find yourself with a lot of text before a menu, we generally
recommend moving all but a couple of paragraphs into a new subnode.
Otherwise, it is easy for readers to miss the menu.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Menu Parts,  Next: Less Cluttered Menu Entry,  Prev: Menu Location,  Up: Menus

4.9.4 The Parts of a Menu
-------------------------

A menu entry has three parts, only the second of which is required:

  1. The menu entry name (optional).

  2. The name of the node (required).

  3. A description of the item (optional).

   The template for a generic menu entry looks like this (but see the
next section for one more possibility):

     * MENU-ENTRY-NAME: NODE-NAME.   DESCRIPTION

   Follow the menu entry name with a single colon, and follow the node
name with tab, comma, newline, or the two characters period and space
('. ').

   The third part of a menu entry is a descriptive phrase or sentence.
Menu entry names and node names are often short; the description
explains to the reader what the node is about.  A useful description
complements the node name rather than repeats it.  The description,
which is optional, can spread over multiple lines; if it does, some
authors prefer to indent the second line while others prefer to align it
with the first (and all others).  It's up to you.  An empty line, or the
next menu entry, ends a description.

   Space characters in a menu are preserved as-is in the Info output;
this allows you to format the menu as you wish.  Unfortunately you must
type node names without any extra spaces or some versions of some Info
readers will not find the node (*note Node Line Requirements::).

   'makeinfo' warns when the text of a menu item (and node names and
cross-references) contains a problematic construct that will interfere
with its parsing in Info.  If you don't want to see the warnings, you
can set the customization variable 'INFO_SPECIAL_CHARS_WARNING' to '0'
(*note Other Customization Variables::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Less Cluttered Menu Entry,  Next: Other Info Files,  Prev: Menu Parts,  Up: Menus

4.9.5 Less Cluttered Menu Entry
-------------------------------

When the menu entry name and node name are the same, you can write the
name immediately after the asterisk and space at the beginning of the
line and follow the name with two colons.

   For example, write

     * Name::                        DESCRIPTION

instead of

     * Name: Name.                   DESCRIPTION

   We recommend using the node name for the menu entry name whenever
possible, since it reduces visual clutter in the menu.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Other Info Files,  Prev: Less Cluttered Menu Entry,  Up: Menus

4.9.6 Referring to Other Info Files
-----------------------------------

You can create a menu entry that enables a reader in Info to go to a
node in another Info file by writing the file name in parentheses just
before the node name.  Some examples:

     @menu
     * FIRST-ENTRY-NAME:(FILENAME)NODENAME.     DESCRIPTION
     * (FILENAME)SECOND-NODE::                  DESCRIPTION
     @end menu

   For example, to refer directly to the 'Outlining' and 'Rebinding'
nodes in the 'Emacs Manual', you could write a menu like this:

     @menu
     * Outlining: (emacs)Outline Mode. The major mode for
                                        editing outlines.
     * (emacs)Rebinding::              How to redefine the
                                        meaning of a key.
     @end menu

   If you do not list the node name, but only name the file, then Info
presumes that you are referring to the 'Top' node.  Examples:

     * Info: (info).         Documentation browsing system.
     * (emacs)::             The extensible, self-documenting
                              text editor.

   The GNU Emacs Texinfo mode menu updating commands only work with
nodes within the current buffer, so you cannot use them to create menus
that refer to other files.  You must write such menus by hand.

5 Chapter Structuring
*********************

Texinfo's "chapter structuring" commands divide a document into a
hierarchy of chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.  These
commands generate large headings in the text, like the one above.  They
also provide information for generating the table of contents (*note
Generating a Table of Contents: Contents.).

   Normally you put a '@node' command immediately before each chapter
structuring command.  *Note Nodes::.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Tree Structuring,  Next: Structuring Command Types,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.1 Tree Structure of Sections
==============================

A Texinfo file is usually structured like a book with chapters,
sections, subsections, and the like.  This structure can be visualized
as a tree (or rather as an upside-down tree) with the root at the top
and the levels corresponding to chapters, sections, subsection, and
subsubsections.

   Here is a diagram that shows a Texinfo file with three chapters, each
with two sections.

                              Top
                               |
             -------------------------------------
            |                  |                  |
         Chapter 1          Chapter 2          Chapter 3
            |                  |                  |
         --------           --------           --------
        |        |         |        |         |        |
     Section  Section   Section  Section   Section  Section
       1.1      1.2       2.1      2.2       3.1      3.2


   In a Texinfo file that has this structure, the beginning of Chapter 2
would be written like this:

     @node    Chapter 2
     @chapter Chapter 2

For purposes of example, here is how it would be written with explicit
node pointers:

     @node    Chapter 2,  Chapter 3, Chapter 1, Top
     @chapter Chapter 2

   The chapter structuring commands are described in the sections that
follow; the '@node' command is described in the previous chapter (*note
Nodes::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Structuring Command Types,  Next: @chapter,  Prev: Tree Structuring,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.2 Structuring Command Types
=============================

The chapter structuring commands fall into four groups or series, each
of which contains structuring commands corresponding to the hierarchical
levels of chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

   The four groups of commands are the '@chapter' series, the
'@unnumbered' series, the '@appendix' series, and the '@heading' series.
Each command produces a title with a different appearance in the body of
the document.  Some of the commands list their titles in the tables of
contents, while others do not.  Here are the details:

   * The '@chapter' and '@appendix' series of commands produce numbered
     or lettered entries both in the body of a document and in its table
     of contents.

   * The '@unnumbered' series of commands produce unnumbered entries
     both in the body of a document and in its table of contents.  The
     '@top' command, which has a special use, is a member of this series
     (*note @top Command::).  An '@unnumbered' section is a normal part
     of the document structure.

   * The '@heading' series of commands produce simple unnumbered
     headings that do not appear in a table of contents, are not
     associated with nodes, and cannot be cross-referenced.  These
     heading commands never start a new page.

   When a '@setchapternewpage' command says to do so, the '@chapter',
'@unnumbered', and '@appendix' commands start new pages in the printed
manual; the '@heading' commands do not.  *Note @setchapternewpage::.

   Here is a summary:

                                                            No new page
Numbered       Unnumbered             Lettered/numbered     Unnumbered
In contents    In contents            In contents           Not in
                                                            contents
               '@top'                                       '@majorheading'
'@chapter'     '@unnumbered'          '@appendix'           '@chapheading'
'@section'     '@unnumberedsec'       '@appendixsec'        '@heading'
'@subsection'  '@unnumberedsubsec'    '@appendixsubsec'     '@subheading'
'@subsubsection''@unnumberedsubsubsec''@appendixsubsubsec'  '@subsubheading'


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @chapter,  Next: @unnumbered @appendix,  Prev: Structuring Command Types,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.3 '@chapter': Chapter Structuring
===================================

'@chapter' identifies a chapter in the document-the highest level of the
normal document structuring hierarchy.  Write the command at the
beginning of a line and follow it on the same line by the title of the
chapter.  The chapter is numbered automatically, starting from 1.

   For example, the present chapter in this manual is entitled
"'@chapter': Chapter Structuring"; the '@chapter' line looks like this:

     @chapter @code{@@chapter}: Chapter Structuring

   In TeX, the '@chapter' command produces a chapter heading in the
document.

   In Info and plain text output, the '@chapter' command causes the
title to appear on a line by itself, with a line of asterisks inserted
underneath.  So, the above example produces the following output:

     5 Chapter Structuring
     *********************

   In HTML, the '@chapter' command produces an '<h2>'-level header by
default (controlled by the 'CHAPTER_HEADER_LEVEL' customization
variable, *note Other Customization Variables::).

   In the XML and Docbook output, a '<chapter>' element is produced that
includes all the following sections, up to the next chapter.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @unnumbered @appendix,  Next: @majorheading @chapheading,  Prev: @chapter,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.4 '@unnumbered', '@appendix': Chapters with Other Labeling
============================================================

Use the '@unnumbered' command to start a chapter-level element that
appears without chapter numbers of any kind.  Use the '@appendix'
command to start an appendix that is labeled by letter ('A', 'B', ...)
instead of by number; appendices are also at the chapter level of
structuring.

   Write an '@appendix' or '@unnumbered' command at the beginning of a
line and follow it on the same line by the title, just as with
'@chapter'.

   Texinfo also provides a command '@centerchap', which is analogous to
'@unnumbered', but centers its argument in the printed and HTML outputs.
This kind of stylistic choice is not usually offered by Texinfo.  It may
be suitable for short documents.

   With '@unnumbered', if the name of the associated node is one of
these English words (case-insensitive):

     Acknowledgements  Colophon  Dedication  Preface

then the Docbook output uses corresponding special tags ('<preface>',
etc.) instead of the default '<chapter>'.  The argument to '@unnumbered'
itself can be anything, and is output as the following '<title>' text as
usual.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @majorheading @chapheading,  Next: @section,  Prev: @unnumbered @appendix,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.5 '@majorheading', '@chapheading': Chapter-level Headings
===========================================================

The '@majorheading' and '@chapheading' commands produce chapter-like
headings in the body of a document.

   However, neither command produces an entry in the table of contents,
and neither command causes TeX to start a new page in a printed manual.

   In TeX, a '@majorheading' command generates a larger vertical
whitespace before the heading than a '@chapheading' command but is
otherwise the same.

   In Info and plain text, the '@majorheading' and '@chapheading'
commands produce the same output as '@chapter': the title is printed on
a line by itself with a line of asterisks underneath.  Similarly for
HTML.  The only difference is the lack of numbering and the lack of any
association with nodes.  *Note @chapter::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @section,  Next: @unnumberedsec @appendixsec @heading,  Prev: @majorheading @chapheading,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.6 '@section': Sections Below Chapters
=======================================

An '@section' command identifies a section within a chapter unit,
whether created with '@chapter', '@unnumbered', or '@appendix',
following the numbering scheme of the chapter-level command.  Thus,
within a '@chapter' chapter numbered '1', the sections are numbered
'1.1', '1.2', etc.; within an '@appendix' "chapter" labeled 'A', the
sections are numbered 'A.1', 'A.2', etc.; within an '@unnumbered'
chapter, the section gets no number.  The output is underlined with '='
in Info and plain text.

   To make a section, write the '@section' command at the beginning of a
line and follow it on the same line by the section title.  For example,

     @section This is a section

might produce the following in Info:

     5.7 This is a section
     =====================

   Section titles are listed in the table of contents.

   The TeX, HTML, Docbook, and XML output is all analogous to the
chapter-level output, just "one level down"; *note @chapter::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @unnumberedsec @appendixsec @heading,  Next: @subsection,  Prev: @section,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.7 '@unnumberedsec', '@appendixsec', '@heading'
================================================

The '@unnumberedsec', '@appendixsec', and '@heading' commands are,
respectively, the unnumbered, appendix-like, and heading-like
equivalents of the '@section' command (see the previous section).

   '@unnumberedsec' and '@appendixsec' do not need to be used in
ordinary circumstances, because '@section' may also be used within
'@unnumbered' and '@appendix' chapters; again, see the previous section.

'@unnumberedsec'
     The '@unnumberedsec' command may be used within an unnumbered
     chapter or within a regular chapter or appendix to produce an
     unnumbered section.

'@appendixsec'
'@appendixsection'
     '@appendixsection' is a longer spelling of the '@appendixsec'
     command; the two are synonymous.

     Conventionally, the '@appendixsec' or '@appendixsection' command is
     used only within appendices.

'@heading'
     You may use the '@heading' command (almost) anywhere for a
     section-style heading that will not appear in the table of
     contents.  The '@heading'-series commands can appear inside most
     environments, for example, though pathological and useless
     locations such as inside '@titlepage', as an argument to another
     command, etc., are not allowed.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @subsection,  Next: @unnumberedsubsec @appendixsubsec @subheading,  Prev: @unnumberedsec @appendixsec @heading,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.8 '@subsection': Subsections Below Sections
=============================================

Subsections are to sections as sections are to chapters; *note
@section::.  In Info and plain text, subsection titles are underlined
with '-'.  For example,

     @subsection This is a subsection

might produce

     1.2.3 This is a subsection
     --------------------------

   Subsection titles are listed in the table of contents.

   The TeX, HTML, Docbook, and XML output is all analogous to the
chapter-level output, just "two levels down"; *note @chapter::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @unnumberedsubsec @appendixsubsec @subheading,  Next: @subsubsection,  Prev: @subsection,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.9 The '@subsection'-like Commands
===================================

The '@unnumberedsubsec', '@appendixsubsec', and '@subheading' commands
are, respectively, the unnumbered, appendix-like, and heading-like
equivalents of the '@subsection' command.  (*Note @subsection::.)

   '@unnumberedsubsec' and '@appendixsubsec' do not need to be used in
ordinary circumstances, because '@subsection' may also be used within
sections of '@unnumbered' and '@appendix' chapters (*note @section::).

   An '@subheading' command produces a heading like that of a subsection
except that it is not numbered and does not appear in the table of
contents.  Similarly, an '@unnumberedsubsec' command produces an
unnumbered heading like that of a subsection and an '@appendixsubsec'
command produces a subsection-like heading labeled with a letter and
numbers; both of these commands produce headings that appear in the
table of contents.  In Info and plain text, the '@subsection'-like
commands generate a title underlined with hyphens.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @subsubsection,  Next: @part,  Prev: @unnumberedsubsec @appendixsubsec @subheading,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.10 '@subsection' and Other Subsub Commands
============================================

The fourth and lowest level sectioning commands in Texinfo are the
'subsub' commands.  They are:

'@subsubsection'
     Subsubsections are to subsections as subsections are to sections.
     (*Note @subsection::.)  Subsubsection titles appear in the table of
     contents.

'@unnumberedsubsubsec'
     Unnumbered subsubsection titles appear in the table of contents,
     but lack numbers.  Otherwise, unnumbered subsubsections are the
     same as subsubsections.

'@appendixsubsubsec'
     Conventionally, appendix commands are used only for appendices and
     are lettered and numbered appropriately.  They also appear in the
     table of contents.

'@subsubheading'
     The '@subsubheading' command may be used anywhere that you want a
     small heading that will not appear in the table of contents.

   As with subsections, '@unnumberedsubsubsec' and '@appendixsubsubsec'
do not need to be used in ordinary circumstances, because
'@subsubsection' may also be used within subsections of '@unnumbered'
and '@appendix' chapters (*note @section::).

   In Info, 'subsub' titles are underlined with periods.  For example,

     @subsubsection This is a subsubsection

might produce

     1.2.3.4 This is a subsubsection
     ...............................

   The TeX, HTML, Docbook, and XML output is all analogous to the
chapter-level output, just "three levels down"; *note @chapter::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @part,  Next: Raise/lower sections,  Prev: @subsubsection,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.11 '@part': Groups of Chapters
================================

The final sectioning command is '@part', to mark a "part" of a manual,
that is, a group of chapters or (rarely) appendices.  This behaves quite
differently from the other sectioning commands, to fit with the way such
"parts" are conventionally used in books.

   No '@node' command is associated with '@part'.  Just write the
command on a line by itself, including the part title, at the place in
the document you want to mark off as starting that part.  For example:

     @part Part I:@* The beginning

   As can be inferred from this example, no automatic numbering or
labeling of the '@part' text is done.  The text is taken as-is.

   Because parts are not associated with nodes, no general text can
follow the '@part' line.  To produce the intended output, it must be
followed by a chapter-level command (including its node).  Thus, to
continue the example:

     @part Part I:@* The beginning

     @node Introduction
     @chapter Introduction
     ...

   In the TeX output, the '@part' text is included in both the normal
and short tables of contents (*note Contents::), without a page number
(since that is the normal convention).  In addition, a "part page" is
output in the body of the document, with just the '@part' text.  In the
example above, the '@*' causes a line break on the part page (but is
replaced with a space in the tables of contents).  This part page is
always forced to be on an odd (right-hand) page, regardless of the
chapter pagination (*note @setchapternewpage::).

   In the HTML output, the '@part' text is similarly included in the
tables of contents, and a heading is included in the main document text,
as part of the following chapter or appendix node.

   In the XML and Docbook output, the '<part>' element includes all the
following chapters, up to the next '<part>'.  A '<part>' containing
chapters is also closed at an appendix.

   In the Info and plain text output, '@part' has no effect.

   '@part' is ignored when raising or lowering sections (see next
section).  That is, it is never lowered and nothing can be raised to it.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Raise/lower sections,  Prev: @part,  Up: Chapter Structuring

5.12 Raise/lower Sections: '@raisesections' and '@lowersections'
================================================================

The '@raisesections' and '@lowersections' commands implicitly raise and
lower the hierarchical level of following chapters, sections and the
other sectioning commands (excluding parts).

   That is, the '@raisesections' command changes sections to chapters,
subsections to sections, and so on.  Conversely, the '@lowersections'
command changes chapters to sections, sections to subsections, and so
on.  Thus, a '@lowersections' command cancels a '@raisesections'
command, and vice versa.

   You can use '@lowersections' to include text written as an outer or
standalone Texinfo file in another Texinfo file as an inner, included
file (*note Include Files::).  Typical usage looks like this:

     @lowersections
     @include somefile.texi
     @raisesections

(Without the '@raisesections', all the subsequent sections in the main
file would also be lowered.)

   If the included file being lowered has a '@top' node, you'll need to
conditionalize its inclusion with a flag (*note @set @value::).

   As a practical matter, you generally only want to raise or lower
large chunks, usually in external files as shown above.  The final
result has to have menus that take the raising and lowering into
account, so you cannot just arbitrarily sprinkle '@raisesections' and
'@lowersections' commands throughout the document.

   Repeated use of the commands continues to raise or lower the
hierarchical level a step at a time.  An attempt to raise above
'chapter' reproduces chapter commands; an attempt to lower below
'subsubsection' reproduces subsubsection commands.  Also, lowered
subsubsections and raised chapters will not work with 'makeinfo''s
feature of implicitly determining node pointers, since the menu
structure cannot be represented correctly.

   Write each '@raisesections' and '@lowersections' command on a line of
its own.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: References,  Next: Cross Reference Commands,  Up: Cross References

6.1 What References Are For
===========================

Often, but not always, a printed document should be designed so that it
can be read sequentially.  People tire of flipping back and forth to
find information that should be presented to them as they need it.

   However, in any document, some information will be too detailed for
the current context, or incidental to it; use cross-references to
provide access to such information.  Also, an online help system or a
reference manual is not like a novel; few read such documents in
sequence from beginning to end.  Instead, people look up what they need.
For this reason, such creations should contain many cross references to
help readers find other information that they may not have read.

   In a printed manual, a cross-reference results in a page reference,
unless it is to another manual altogether, in which case the
cross-reference names that manual.  In Info, a cross-reference results
in an entry that you can follow using the Info 'f' command.  (*Note
Following cross-references: (info)Help-Xref.)  In HTML, a
cross-reference results in an hyperlink.

   The various cross-reference commands use nodes (or anchors, *note
@anchor::) to define cross-reference locations.  TeX needs nodes to
define cross-reference locations.  When TeX generates a DVI file, it
records each node's page number and uses the page numbers in making
references.  Thus, even if you are writing a manual that will only be
printed, and not used online, you must nonetheless write '@node' lines
in order to name the places to which you make cross-references.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Cross Reference Commands,  Next: Cross Reference Parts,  Prev: References,  Up: Cross References

6.2 Different Cross-reference Commands
======================================

There are three different cross-reference commands:

'@xref'
     Used to start a sentence in the printed manual and in HTML with
     'See ...' or an Info cross-reference saying '*Note NAME: NODE.'.

'@ref'
     Used within or, more often, at the end of a sentence; produces just
     the reference in the printed manual and in HTML without the
     preceding 'See' (same as '@xref' for Info).

'@pxref'
     Used within parentheses, at the end of a sentence, or otherwise
     before punctuation, to make a reference.  Its output starts with a
     lowercase 'see' in the printed manual and in HTML, and a lowercase
     '*note' in Info.  ('p' is for 'parenthesis'.)

   Additionally, there are commands to produce references to documents
outside the Texinfo system.  The '@cite' command is used to make
references to books and manuals.  '@url' produces a URL, for example a
reference to a page on the World Wide Web.  '@inforef' is used to make a
reference to an Info file for which there is no printed manual.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Cross Reference Parts,  Next: @xref,  Prev: Cross Reference Commands,  Up: Cross References

6.3 Parts of a Cross-reference
==============================

A cross-reference command requires only one argument, which is the name
of the node to which it refers.  Here is a simple example:

     @xref{Node name}.

In Info output, this produces

     *Note Node name::.

In a printed manual, the output is

     See Section NNN [Node name], page PPP.

   A cross-reference command may contain up to four additional
arguments.  By using these arguments, you can provide a cross-reference
name, a topic description or section title for the printed output, the
name of a different manual file, and the name of a different printed
manual.  To refer to another manual as a whole, the manual file and/or
the name of the printed manual are the only required arguments (*note
Referring to a Manual as a Whole::).

   Here is an example of a full five-part cross-reference:

     @xref{Node name, Online Label, Printed Label,
     info-file-name, A Printed Manual}, for details.

which produces

     *Note Online Label: (info-file-name)Node name,
     for details.

in Info and

     See section "Printed Label" in A Printed Manual, for details.

in a printed book.

   The five possible arguments for a cross-reference are:

  1. The node or anchor name (required, except for reference to whole
     manuals).  This is the location to which the cross-reference takes
     you.  In a printed document, the location of the node provides the
     page reference only for references within the same document.  Use
     '@node' to define the node (*note Writing a Node::), or '@anchor'
     (*note @anchor::).

     Write a node name in a cross-reference in exactly the same way as
     in the '@node' line, including the same capitalization; otherwise,
     the formatters may not find the reference.

  2. A label for online output.  It is usually omitted; then the topic
     description (third argument) is used if it was specified; if that
     was omitted as well, the node name is used.

  3. A label for printed output.  Often, this is the title or topic of
     the section.  This is used as the name of the reference in the
     printed manual.  If omitted, the node name is used.

  4. The name of the manual file in which the reference is located, if
     it is different from the current file.  This name is used both for
     Info and HTML.

  5. The name of a printed manual from a different Texinfo file.

   The template for a full five argument cross-reference looks like
this:

     @xref{NODE-NAME, ONLINE-LABEL, PRINTED-LABEL,
     INFO-FILE-NAME, PRINTED-MANUAL-TITLE}

   Whitespace before and after the commas separating these arguments is
ignored.  To include a comma in one of the arguments, use '@comma{}'
(*note Inserting a Comma::).

   When processing with TeX, a comma is automatically inserted after the
page number for cross-references to within the same manual, unless the
closing brace of the argument is followed by non-whitespace (such as a
comma or period).  This gives you the choice of whether to have a comma
there in Info or HTML output.  For example,

     @xref{Another Section} for more information

produces 'See Another Section, page PPP, for more information' in the
printed output, and '*Note Another Section:: for more information' in
the Info output.

   If an unwanted comma is added, follow the argument with a command
such as '@:'.  For example, '@xref{Hurricanes}@: --- for the details'
produces

     See Hurricanes, page PPP -- for the details

instead of 'See Hurricanes, page PPP, -- for the details'.

   Cross-references with one, two, three, four, and five arguments are
described separately following the description of '@xref'.

   'makeinfo' warns when the text of a cross-reference (and node names
and menu items) contains a problematic construct that will interfere
with its parsing in Info.  If you don't want to see the warnings, you
can set the customization variable 'INFO_SPECIAL_CHARS_WARNING' to '0'
(*note Other Customization Variables::).

6.4 '@xref'
===========

The '@xref' command generates a cross-reference for the beginning of a
sentence.

* Menu:

* One Argument::                '@xref' with one argument.
* Two Arguments::               '@xref' with two arguments.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: One Argument,  Next: Two Arguments,  Up: @xref

6.4.1 '@xref' with One Argument
-------------------------------

The simplest form of '@xref' takes one argument, the name of another
node in the same Texinfo file.

For example,

     @xref{Tropical Storms}.

produces

     *Note Tropical Storms::.

in Info and

     See Section 3.1 [Tropical Storms], page 24.

in a printed manual.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Two Arguments,  Next: Three Arguments,  Prev: One Argument,  Up: @xref

6.4.2 '@xref' with Two Arguments
--------------------------------

With two arguments, the second is used as a label for the online output.

The template is like this:

     @xref{NODE-NAME, ONLINE-LABEL}.

For example,

     @xref{Electrical Effects, Lightning}.

produces:

     *Note Lightning: Electrical Effects.

in Info and

     See Section 5.2 [Electrical Effects], page 57.

in a printed manual, where the node name is printed.

   The second argument to cross-references must observe some of the
restrictions for node names (*note Node Line Requirements::).  The most
common issue is that colons cannot be used, since that interferes with
the parsing of the Info file.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Three Arguments,  Next: Four and Five Arguments,  Prev: Two Arguments,  Up: @xref

6.4.3 '@xref' with Three Arguments
----------------------------------

A third argument replaces the node name in the TeX output.  The third
argument should be the name of the section in the printed output, or
else state the topic discussed by that section.

The template is like this:

     @xref{NODE-NAME, ONLINE-LABEL, PRINTED-LABEL}.

For example,

     @xref{Electrical Effects, Lightning, Thunder and Lightning},
     for details.

produces

     *Note Lightning: Electrical Effects, for details.

in Info and

     See Section 5.2 [Thunder and Lightning], page 57, for details.

in a printed manual.

   If a third argument is given and the second one is empty, then the
third argument serves for both.  (Note how two commas, side by side,
mark the empty second argument.)

     @xref{Electrical Effects, , Thunder and Lightning},
     for details.

produces

     *Note Thunder and Lightning: Electrical Effects, for details.

in Info and

     See Section 5.2 [Thunder and Lightning], page 57, for details.

in a printed manual.

   The third argument to cross-references must observe some of the
restrictions for node names (*note Node Line Requirements::).  The most
common issue is that colons cannot be used, since that interferes with
the parsing of the Info file.

   As a practical matter, it is often best to write cross-references
with just the first argument if the node name and the section title are
the same (or nearly so), and with the first and third arguments only if
the node name and title are different.

   Texinfo offers a setting to use the section title instead of node
names by default in cross-references (an explicitly specified third
argument still takes precedence):

     @xrefautomaticsectiontitle on

   Typically this line would be given near the beginning of the document
and used for the whole manual.  But you can turn it off if you want
('@xrefautomaticsectiontitle off'), for example, if you're including
some other sub-document that doesn't have suitable section names.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Four and Five Arguments,  Prev: Three Arguments,  Up: @xref

6.4.4 '@xref' with Four and Five Arguments
------------------------------------------

In a cross-reference, a fourth argument specifies the name of another
Info file, different from the file in which the reference appears, and a
fifth argument specifies its title as a printed manual.

The full template is:

     @xref{NODE-NAME, ONLINE-LABEL, PRINTED-LABEL,
     INFO-FILE-NAME, PRINTED-MANUAL-TITLE}.

For example,

     @xref{Electrical Effects, Lightning, Thunder and Lightning,
     weather, An Introduction to Meteorology}.

produces this output in Info:

     *Note Lightning: (weather)Electrical Effects.

As you can see, the name of the Info file is enclosed in parentheses and
precedes the name of the node.

In a printed manual, the reference looks like this:

     See section "Thunder and Lightning" in 'An Introduction to
     Meteorology'.

The title of the printed manual is typeset like '@cite'; and the
reference lacks a page number since TeX cannot know to which page a
reference refers when that reference is to another manual.

   Next case: often, you will leave out the second argument when you use
the long version of '@xref'.  In this case, the third argument, the
topic description, will be used as the cross-reference name in Info.
For example,

     @xref{Electrical Effects, , Thunder and Lightning,
     weather, An Introduction to Meteorology}.

produces

     *Note Thunder and Lightning: (weather)Electrical Effects.

in Info and

     See section "Thunder and Lightning" in 'An Introduction to
     Meteorology'.

in a printed manual.

   Next case: If the node name and the section title are the same in the
other manual, you may also leave out the section title.  In this case,
the node name is used in both instances.  For example,

     @xref{Electrical Effects,,,
     weather, An Introduction to Meteorology}.

produces

     *Note (weather)Electrical Effects::.

in Info and

     See section "Electrical Effects" in 'An Introduction to
     Meteorology'.

in a printed manual.

   A very unusual case: you may want to refer to another manual file
that is within a single printed manual--when multiple Texinfo files are
incorporated into the same TeX run but can create separate Info or HTML
output files.  In this case, you need to specify only the fourth
argument, and not the fifth.

   Finally, it's also allowed to leave out all the arguments _except_
the fourth and fifth, to refer to another manual as a whole.  See the
next section.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Referring to a Manual as a Whole,  Next: @ref,  Prev: @xref,  Up: Cross References

6.5 Referring to a Manual as a Whole
====================================

Ordinarily, you must always name a node in a cross-reference.  However,
it's not unusual to want to refer to another manual as a whole, rather
than a particular section within it.  In this case, giving any section
name is an unnecessary distraction.

   So, with cross-references to other manuals (*note Four and Five
Arguments::), if the first argument is either 'Top' (capitalized just
that way) or omitted entirely, and the third argument is omitted, the
printed output includes no node or section name.  (The Info output
includes 'Top' if it was given.)  For example,

     @xref{Top,,, make, The GNU Make Manual}.

produces

     *Note (make)Top::.

and

     See 'The GNU Make Manual'.

Info readers will go to the Top node of the manual whether or not the
'Top' node is explicitly specified.

   It's also possible (and is historical practice) to refer to a whole
manual by specifying the 'Top' node and an appropriate entry for the
third argument to the '@xref' command.  Using this idiom, to make a
cross-reference to 'The GNU Make Manual', you would write:

     @xref{Top,, Overview, make, The GNU Make Manual}.

which produces

     *Note Overview: (make)Top.

in Info and

     See section "Overview" in 'The GNU Make Manual'.

in a printed manual.

   In this example, 'Top' is the name of the first node, and 'Overview'
is the name of the first section of the manual.  There is no widely-used
convention for naming the first section in a printed manual, this is
just what the Make manual happens to use.  This arbitrariness of the
first name is a principal reason why omitting the third argument in
whole-manual cross-references is preferable.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @ref,  Next: @pxref,  Prev: Referring to a Manual as a Whole,  Up: Cross References

6.6 '@ref'
==========

'@ref' is nearly the same as '@xref' except that it does not generate a
'See' in the printed output, just the reference itself.  This makes it
useful as the last part of a sentence.

For example,

     For more information, @pxref{This}, and @ref{That}.

produces in Info:

     For more information, *note This::, and *note That::.

and in printed output:

     For more information, see Section 1.1 [This], page 1, and Section
     1.2 [That], page 2.

   The '@ref' command can tempt writers to express themselves in a
manner that is suitable for a printed manual but looks awkward in the
Info format.  Bear in mind that your audience could be using both the
printed and the Info format.  For example:

     Sea surges are described in @ref{Hurricanes}.

looks ok in the printed output:

     Sea surges are described in Section 6.7 [Hurricanes], page 72.

but is awkward to read in Info, "note" being a verb:

     Sea surges are described in *note Hurricanes::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @pxref,  Next: @anchor,  Prev: @ref,  Up: Cross References

6.7 '@pxref'
============

The parenthetical reference command, '@pxref', is nearly the same as
'@xref', but it is best used within parentheses.  The command differs
from '@xref' in that TeX typesets the reference for the printed manual
with a lowercase 'see' rather than an uppercase 'See'.

With one argument, a parenthetical cross-reference looks like this:

     ... storms cause flooding (@pxref{Hurricanes}) ...

which produces

     ... storms cause flooding (*note Hurricanes::) ...

in Info and

     ... storms cause flooding (see Section 6.7 [Hurricanes], page 72)
     ...

in a printed manual.

   With two arguments, a parenthetical cross-reference has this
template:

     ... (@pxref{NODE-NAME, CROSS-REFERENCE-NAME}) ...

which produces

     ... (*note CROSS-REFERENCE-NAME: NODE-NAME.) ...

in Info and

     ... (see Section NNN [NODE-NAME], page PPP) ...

in a printed manual.

   '@pxref' can be used with up to five arguments, just like '@xref'
(*note @xref::).

   In past versions of Texinfo, it was not allowed to write punctuation
after a '@pxref', so it could be used _only_ before a right parenthesis.
This is no longer the case.  The effect of '@pxref{NODE-NAME}' is
similar to that of 'see @ref{NODE-NAME}'.  However, in many circumstance
the latter is preferrable, as this makes it clear in the Info output
that the word "see" should be present.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @anchor,  Next: @inforef,  Prev: @pxref,  Up: Cross References

6.8 '@anchor': Defining Arbitrary Cross-reference Targets
=========================================================

An "anchor" is a position in your document, labelled so that
cross-references can refer to it, just as they can to nodes.  You create
an anchor with the '@anchor' command, and give the label as a normal
brace-delimited argument.  For example:

     This marks the @anchor{x-spot}spot.
     ...
     @xref{x-spot,,the spot}.

produces:

     This marks the spot.
     ...
     See [the spot], page 1.

   As you can see, the '@anchor' command itself produces no output.
This example defines an anchor 'x-spot' just before the word 'spot'.
You can refer to it later with an '@xref' or other cross reference
command, as shown (*note Cross References::).

   It is best to put '@anchor' commands just before the position you
wish to refer to; that way, the reader's eye is led on to the correct
text when they jump to the anchor.  You can put the '@anchor' command on
a line by itself if that helps readability of the source.  Whitespace
(including newlines) is ignored after '@anchor'.

   Anchor names and node names may not conflict.  Anchors and nodes are
given similar treatment in some ways; for example, the 'goto-node'
command takes either an anchor name or a node name as an argument.
(*Note (info)Go to node::.)

   Also like node names, anchor names cannot include some characters
(*note Node Line Requirements::).

   Because of this duality, when you delete or rename a node, it is
usually a good idea to define an '@anchor' with the old name.  That way,
any links to the old node, whether from other Texinfo manuals or general
web pages, keep working.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @inforef,  Next: @url,  Prev: @anchor,  Up: Cross References

6.9 '@inforef': Cross-references to Info-only Material
======================================================

'@inforef' is used for making cross-references to Info documents--even
from a printed manual.  This might be because you want to refer to
conditional '@ifinfo' text (*note Conditionals::), or because printed
output is not available (perhaps because there is no Texinfo source),
among other possibilities.

   The command takes either two or three arguments, in the following
order:

  1. The node name.

  2. The cross-reference name (optional).

  3. The Info file name.

The template is:

     @inforef{NODE-NAME, CROSS-REFERENCE-NAME, INFO-FILE-NAME}

For example,

     @inforef{Advanced, Advanced Info commands, info},
     for more information.

produces (in Info):

     *Note Advanced Info commands: (info)Advanced,
     for more information.

and (in the printed output):

     See Info file 'info', node 'Advanced', for more information.

   (This particular example is not realistic, since the Info manual is
written in Texinfo, so all formats are available.  In fact, we don't
know of any extant Info-only manuals.)

   The converse of '@inforef' is '@cite', which is used to refer to
printed works for which no Info form exists.  *Note @cite::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @url,  Next: @cite,  Prev: @inforef,  Up: Cross References

6.10 '@url', '@uref{URL[, TEXT][, REPLACEMENT]}'
================================================

'@url' produces a reference to a uniform resource locator (url).  It
takes one mandatory argument, the url, and two optional arguments which
control the text that is displayed.  In HTML and PDF output, '@url'
produces a link you can follow.  (To merely indicate a url without
creating a link people can follow, use '@indicateurl', *note
@indicateurl::.)

   '@uref' is a synonym for '@url'.  (Originally, '@url' had the meaning
of '@indicateurl' and '@uref' was required to produce a working link,
but in practice '@url' was almost always misused.  So we've changed the
meaning.)

   The second argument, if specified, is the text to display (the
default is the url itself); in Info, DVI, and PDF output, but not in
HTML output, the url is output in addition to this text.

   The third argument, if specified, is the text to display, but in this
case the url is not output in any format.  This is useful when the text
is already sufficiently referential, as in a man page.  Also, if the
third argument is given, the second argument is ignored.

* Menu:

6.10.1 '@url' Examples
----------------------

First, here is an example of the simplest form of '@url', with just one
argument.  The given url is both the target and the visible text of the
link:

     The official GNU ftp site is @url{http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu}.

produces:
     The official GNU ftp site is <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu>.

Two-argument form of '@url'
...........................

Here is an example of the two-argument form:
     The official @url{http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu, GNU ftp site}
     holds programs and texts.

which produces:
     The official GNU ftp site (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu)
     holds programs and texts.

that is, the Info (and TeX, etc.) output is this:

Three-argument form of '@url'
.............................

Finally, an example of the three-argument form:
     The @url{/man.cgi/1/ls,,ls} program ...

which, except for HTML, produces:
     The ls program ...

but with HTML:
     The <a href="/man.cgi/1/ls">ls</a> program ...

   By the way, some people prefer to display urls in the unambiguous
format:

     <URL:http://HOST/PATH>

You can use this form in the input file if you wish.  We feel it's not
necessary to include the '<URL:' and '>' in the output, since to be
useful any software that tries to detect urls in text already has to
detect them without the '<URL:'.

6.10.2 URL Line Breaking
------------------------

TeX allows line breaking within urls at only a few characters (which are
special in urls): '&', '.', '#', '?', and '/' (but not between two '/'
characters).  A tiny amount of stretchable space is also inserted around
these characters to help with line breaking.

   For HTML output, modern browsers will also do line breaking within
displayed urls.  If you need to allow breaks at other characters you can
insert '@/' as needed (*note Line Breaks::).

   By default, in TeX any such breaks at special characters will occur
after the character.  Some people prefer such breaks to happen before
the special character.  This can be controlled with the
'@urefbreakstyle' command (this command has effect only in TeX):

     @urefbreakstyle HOW

where the argument HOW is one of these words:

'after'
     (the default) Potentially break after the special characters.
'before'
     Potentially break before the special characters.
'none'
     Do not consider breaking at the special characters at all; any
     potential breaks must be manually inserted.

6.10.3 '@url' PDF Output Format
-------------------------------

If the ultimate purpose of a PDF is only to be viewed online, perhaps
similar to HTML in some inchoate way, you may not want the urls to be
included in the visible text (just as urls are not visible to readers of
web pages).  Texinfo provides a PDF-specific option for this, which must
be used inside '@tex':

     @tex
     \global\urefurlonlylinktrue
     @end tex

   The result is that '@url{http://www.gnu.org, GNU}' has the visible
output of just 'GNU', with a link target of <http://www.gnu.org>.
Ordinarily, the visible output would include both the label and the url:
'GNU (<http://www.gnu.org>)'.

   This option only has effect when the PDF output is produced with the
pdfTeX program, not with other ways of getting from Texinfo to PDF
(e.g., TeX to DVI to PDF).  Consequently, it is ok to specify this
option unconditionally within '@tex', as shown above.  It is ignored
when DVI is being produced.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: PDF Colors,  Prev: @url PDF Output Format,  Up: @url

6.10.4 PDF Colors
-----------------

By default, urls and cross-reference links are printed in black in PDF
output.  Very occasionally, however, you may want to highlight such
"live" links with a different color, as is commonly done on web pages.
Texinfo provides a PDF-specific option for specifying these colors,
which must be used inside '@tex':

     @tex
     \global\def\linkcolor{1 0 0}  % red
     \global\def\urlcolor{0 1 0}   % green
     @end tex

   '\urlcolor' changes the color of '@url' output (both the actual url
and any textual label), while '\linkcolor' changes the color for
cross-references to nodes, etc.  They are independent.

   The three given values must be numbers between 0 and 1, specifying
the amount of red, green, and blue respectively.

   These definitions only have an effect when the PDF output is produced
with the pdfTeX program, not with other ways of getting from Texinfo to
PDF (e.g., TeX to DVI to PDF).  Consequently, it is ok to specify this
option unconditionally within '@tex', as shown above.  It is ignored
when DVI is being produced.

   We do not recommend colorizing just for fun; unless you have a
specific reason to use colors, best to skip it.

6.11 '@cite'{REFERENCE}
=======================

Use the '@cite' command for the name of a book that lacks a companion
Info file.  The command produces italics in the printed manual, and
quotation marks in the Info file.

   If a book is written in Texinfo, it is better to use a
cross-reference command since a reader can easily follow such a
reference in Info.  *Note @xref::.

7 Marking Text, Words and Phrases
*********************************

In Texinfo, you can mark words and phrases in a variety of ways.  The
Texinfo formatters use this information to determine how to highlight
the text.  You can specify, for example, whether a word or phrase is a
defining occurrence, a metasyntactic variable, or a symbol used in a
program.  Also, you can emphasize text, in several different ways.

7.1 Indicating Definitions, Commands, etc.
==========================================

Texinfo has commands for indicating just what kind of object a piece of
text refers to.  For example, email addresses are marked by '@email';
that way, the result can be a live link to send email when the output
format supports it.  If the email address was simply marked as "print in
a typewriter font", that would not be possible.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: @code,  Next: @kbd,  Prev: Useful Highlighting,  Up: Indicating

7.1.2 '@code'{SAMPLE-CODE}
--------------------------

Use the '@code' command to indicate text that is a piece of a program
and which consists of entire syntactic tokens.  Enclose the text in
braces.

   Thus, you should use '@code' for an expression in a program, for the
name of a variable or function used in a program, or for a keyword in a
programming language.

   Use '@code' for command names in languages that resemble programming
languages, such as Texinfo.  For example, '@code' and '@samp' are
produced by writing '@code{@@code}' and '@code{@@samp}' in the Texinfo
source, respectively.

   It is incorrect to alter the case of a word inside a '@code' command
when it appears at the beginning of a sentence.  Most computer languages
are case sensitive.  In C, for example, 'Printf' is different from the
identifier 'printf', and most likely is a misspelling of it.  Even in
languages which are not case sensitive, it is confusing to a human
reader to see identifiers spelled in different ways.  Pick one spelling
and always use that.  If you do not want to start a sentence with a
command name written all in lowercase, you should rearrange the
sentence.

   In the Info output, '@code' results in single quotation marks around
the text.  In other formats, '@code' argument is typeset in a typewriter
(monospace) font.  For example,

     The function returns @code{nil}.

produces this:

     The function returns 'nil'.

   Here are some cases for which it is preferable _not_ to use '@code':

   * For shell command names, such as 'ls' (use '@command').

   * For environment variables, such as 'TEXINPUTS' (use '@env').

   * For shell options, such as '-c', when such options stand alone (use
     '@option').

   * An entire shell command often looks better if written using '@samp'
     rather than '@code'.  In this case, the rule is to choose the more
     pleasing format.

   * For a string of characters shorter than a syntactic token.  For
     example, if you are writing about 'goto-ch', which is just a part
     of the name for the 'goto-char' Emacs Lisp function, you should use
     '@samp'.

   * In general, when writing about the characters used in a token; for
     example, do not use '@code' when you are explaining what letters or
     printable symbols can be used in the names of functions.  (Use
     '@samp'.)  Also, you should not use '@code' to mark text that is
     considered input to programs unless the input is written in a
     language that is like a programming language.  For example, you
     should not use '@code' for the keystroke commands of GNU Emacs (use
     '@kbd' instead) although you may use '@code' for the names of the
     Emacs Lisp functions that the keystroke commands invoke.

   By default, TeX will consider breaking lines at '-' and '_'
characters within '@code' and related commands.  This can be controlled
with '@allowcodebreaks' (*note @allowcodebreaks::).  The HTML output
attempts to respect this for '-', but ultimately it is up to the
browser's behavior.  For Info, it seems better never to make such
breaks.

   For Info, the quotes are omitted in the output of the '@code' command
and related commands (e.g., '@kbd', '@command'), in typewriter-like
contexts such as the '@example' environment (*note @example::) and
'@code' itself, etc.

   To control which quoting characters are implicitly inserted by
Texinfo processors in the output of '@code', etc., see the
'OPEN_QUOTE_SYMBOL' and 'CLOSE_QUOTE_SYMBOL' customization variables
(*note Other Customization Variables::).  This is separate from how
actual quotation characters in the input document are handled (*note
Inserting Quote Characters::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @kbd,  Next: @key,  Prev: @code,  Up: Indicating

7.1.3 '@kbd'{KEYBOARD-CHARACTERS}
---------------------------------

Use the '@kbd' command for characters of input to be typed by users.
For example, to refer to the characters 'M-a', write:

     @kbd{M-a}

and to refer to the characters 'M-x shell', write:

     @kbd{M-x shell}

   By default, the '@kbd' command produces a different font (slanted
typewriter instead of normal typewriter), so users can distinguish the
characters that they are supposed to type from those that the computer
outputs.

   Since the usage of '@kbd' varies from manual to manual, you can
control the font switching with the '@kbdinputstyle' command.  This
command has no effect on Info output.  Write this command at the
beginning of a line with a single word as an argument, one of the
following:

'code'
     Always use the same font for '@kbd' as '@code'.
'example'
     Use the distinguishing font for '@kbd' only in '@example' and
     similar environments.
'distinct'
     (the default) Always use the distinguishing font for '@kbd'.

   You can embed another @-command inside the braces of a '@kbd'
command.  Here, for example, is the way to describe a command that would
be described more verbosely as "press the 'r' key and then press the
<RETURN> key":

     @kbd{r @key{RET}}

This produces: 'r <RET>'.  (The present manual uses the default for
'@kbdinputstyle'.)

   You also use the '@kbd' command if you are spelling out the letters
you type; for example:

     To give the @code{logout} command,
     type the characters @kbd{l o g o u t @key{RET}}.

This produces:

     To give the 'logout' command, type the characters 'l o g o u t
     <RET>'.

   (Also, this example shows that you can add spaces for clarity.  If
you explicitly want to mention a space character as one of the
characters of input, write '@key{SPC}' for it.)

7.1.4 '@key'{KEY-NAME}
----------------------

Use the '@key' command for the conventional name for a key on a
keyboard, as in:

     @key{RET}

   You can use the '@key' command within the argument of an '@kbd'
command when the sequence of characters to be typed includes one or more
keys that are described by name.

   For example, to produce 'C-x <ESC>' and 'M-<TAB>' you would type:

     @kbd{C-x @key{ESC}}
     @kbd{M-@key{TAB}}

   Here is a list of the recommended names for keys:

     SPC
          Space
     RET
          Return
     LFD
          Linefeed (however, since most keyboards nowadays do not have a
          Linefeed key, it might be better to call this character 'C-j')
     TAB
          Tab
     BS
          Backspace
     ESC
          Escape
     DELETE
          Delete
     SHIFT
          Shift
     CTRL
          Control
     META
          Meta

   There are subtleties to handling words like 'meta' or 'ctrl' that are
names of modifier keys.  When mentioning a character in which the
modifier key is used, such as 'Meta-a', use the '@kbd' command alone; do
not use the '@key' command; but when you are referring to the modifier
key in isolation, use the '@key' command.  For example, write
'@kbd{Meta-a}' to produce 'Meta-a' and '@key{META}' to produce <META>.

   As a convention in GNU manuals, '@key' should not be used in index
entries.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @samp,  Next: @verb,  Prev: @key,  Up: Indicating

7.1.5 '@samp'{TEXT}
-------------------

Use the '@samp' command to indicate text that is a literal example or
'sample' of a sequence of characters in a file, string, pattern, etc.
Enclose the text in braces.  The argument appears within single
quotation marks in both the Info file and the printed manual; in
addition, it is printed in a fixed-width font.

     To match @samp{foo} at the end of the line,
     use the regexp @samp{foo$}.

produces

     To match 'foo' at the end of the line, use the regexp 'foo$'.

   Any time you are referring to single characters, you should use
'@samp' unless '@kbd' or '@key' is more appropriate.  Also, you may use
'@samp' for entire statements in C and for entire shell commands--in
this case, '@samp' often looks better than '@code'.  Basically, '@samp'
is a catchall for whatever is not covered by '@code', '@kbd', '@key',
'@command', etc.

   Only include punctuation marks within braces if they are part of the
string you are specifying.  Write punctuation marks outside the braces
if those punctuation marks are part of the English text that surrounds
the string.  In the following sentence, for example, the commas and
period are outside of the braces:

     In English, the vowels are @samp{a}, @samp{e},
     @samp{i}, @samp{o}, @samp{u}, and sometimes
     @samp{y}.

This produces:

     In English, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and sometimes
     'y'.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @verb,  Next: @var,  Prev: @samp,  Up: Indicating

7.1.6 '@verb'{CHARTEXTCHAR}
---------------------------

Use the '@verb' command to print a verbatim sequence of characters.

   Like LaTeX's '\verb' command, the verbatim text can be quoted using
any unique delimiter character.  Enclose the verbatim text, including
the delimiters, in braces.  Text is printed in a fixed-width font:

     How many @verb{|@|}-escapes does one need to print this
     @verb{.@a @b.@c.} string or @verb{+@'e?`{}!`\+} this?

produces

     How many @-escapes does one need to print this
     @a @b.@c string or @'e?`{}!`\ this?

   This is in contrast to '@samp' (see the previous section), '@code',
and similar commands; in those cases, the argument is normal Texinfo
text, where the three characters '@{}' are special, as usual.  With
'@verb', nothing is special except the delimiter character you choose.

   The delimiter character itself may appear inside the verbatim text,
as shown above.  As another example, '@verb{...}' prints a single
(fixed-width) period.

   It is not reliable to use '@verb' inside other Texinfo constructs.
In particular, it does not work to use '@verb' in anything related to
cross-referencing, such as section titles or figure captions.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @var,  Next: @env,  Prev: @verb,  Up: Indicating

7.1.7 '@var'{METASYNTACTIC-VARIABLE}
------------------------------------

Use the '@var' command to indicate metasyntactic variables.  A
"metasyntactic variable" is something that stands for another piece of
text.  For example, you should use a metasyntactic variable in the
documentation of a function to describe the arguments that are passed to
that function.

   Do not use '@var' for the names of normal variables in computer
programs.  These are specific names, so '@code' is correct for them
('@code').  For example, the Emacs Lisp variable 'texinfo-tex-command'
is not a metasyntactic variable; it is properly formatted using '@code'.

   Do not use '@var' for environment variables either; '@env' is correct
for them (see the next section).

   The effect of '@var' in the Info file is to change the case of the
argument to all uppercase.  In the printed manual and HTML output, the
argument is output in slanted type.

   For example,

     To delete file @var{filename},
     type @samp{rm @var{filename}}.

produces

     To delete file FILENAME, type 'rm FILENAME'.

(Note that '@var' may appear inside '@code', '@samp', '@file', etc.)

   Write a metasyntactic variable all in lowercase without spaces, and
use hyphens to make it more readable.  Thus, the Texinfo source for the
illustration of how to begin a Texinfo manual looks like this:

     \input texinfo
     @@settitle @var{name-of-manual}

This produces:

     \input texinfo
     @settitle NAME-OF-MANUAL

   In some documentation styles, metasyntactic variables are shown with
angle brackets, for example:

     ..., type rm <filename>

However, that is not the style that Texinfo uses.

7.1.8 '@env'{ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE}
----------------------------------

Use the '@env' command to indicate environment variables, as used by
many operating systems, including GNU.  Do not use it for
_meta_syntactic variables; use '@var' for those (see the previous
section).

   '@env' is equivalent to '@code' in its effects.  For example:

     The @env{PATH} environment variable ...
produces
     The 'PATH' environment variable ...


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @file,  Next: @command,  Prev: @env,  Up: Indicating

7.1.9 '@file'{FILE-NAME}
------------------------

Use the '@file' command to indicate text that is the name of a file,
buffer, or directory, or is the name of a node in Info.  You can also
use the command for file name suffixes.  Do not use '@file' for symbols
in a programming language; use '@code'.

   '@file' is equivalent to 'code' in its effects.  For example,

     The @file{.el} files are in
     the @file{/usr/local/emacs/lisp} directory.

produces

     The '.el' files are in the '/usr/local/emacs/lisp' directory.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @command,  Next: @option,  Prev: @file,  Up: Indicating

7.1.10 '@command'{COMMAND-NAME}
-------------------------------

Use the '@command' command to indicate command names, such as 'ls' or
'cc'.

   '@command' is equivalent to '@code' in its effects.  For example:

     The command @command{ls} lists directory contents.
produces
     The command 'ls' lists directory contents.

   You should write the name of a program in the ordinary text font,
rather than using '@command', if you regard it as a new English word,
such as 'Emacs' or 'Bison'.

   When writing an entire shell command invocation, as in 'ls -l', you
should use either '@samp' or '@code' at your discretion.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @option,  Next: @dfn,  Prev: @command,  Up: Indicating

7.1.11 '@option'{OPTION-NAME}
-----------------------------

Use the '@option' command to indicate a command-line option; for
example, '-l' or '--version' or '--output=FILENAME'.

   '@option' is equivalent to '@code' in its effects.  For example:

     The option @option{-l} produces a long listing.
produces
     The option '-l' produces a long listing.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @dfn,  Next: @abbr,  Prev: @option,  Up: Indicating

7.1.12 '@dfn'{TERM}
-------------------

Use the '@dfn' command to identify the introductory or defining use of a
technical term.  Use the command only in passages whose purpose is to
introduce a term which will be used again or which the reader ought to
know.  Mere passing mention of a term for the first time does not
deserve '@dfn'.  The command generates italics in the printed manual,
and double quotation marks in the Info file.  For example:

     Getting rid of a file is called @dfn{deleting} it.

produces

     Getting rid of a file is called "deleting" it.

   As a general rule, a sentence containing the defining occurrence of a
term should be a definition of the term.  The sentence does not need to
say explicitly that it is a definition, but it should contain the
information of a definition--it should make the meaning clear.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @abbr,  Next: @acronym,  Prev: @dfn,  Up: Indicating

7.1.13 '@abbr'{ABBREVIATION[, MEANING]}
---------------------------------------

You can use the '@abbr' command for general abbreviations.  The
abbreviation is given as the single argument in braces, as in
'@abbr{Comput.}'.  As a matter of style, or for particular
abbreviations, you may prefer to omit periods, as in '@abbr{Mr}
Stallman'.

   '@abbr' accepts an optional second argument, intended to be used for
the meaning of the abbreviation.

   If the abbreviation ends with a lowercase letter and a period, and is
not at the end of a sentence, and has no second argument, remember to
use the '@.' command (*note Ending a Sentence::) to get the correct
spacing.  However, you do not have to use '@.' within the abbreviation
itself; Texinfo automatically assumes periods within the abbreviation do
not end a sentence.

   In TeX and in the Info output, the first argument is printed as-is;
if the second argument is present, it is printed in parentheses after
the abbreviation.  In HTML the '<abbr>' tag is used; in Docbook, the
'<abbrev>' tag is used.  For instance:

     @abbr{Comput. J., Computer Journal}

produces:

     Comput. J. (Computer Journal)

   For abbreviations consisting of all capital letters, you may prefer
to use the '@acronym' command instead.  See the next section for more on
the usage of these two commands.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @acronym,  Next: @indicateurl,  Prev: @abbr,  Up: Indicating

7.1.14 '@acronym'{ACRONYM[, MEANING]}
-------------------------------------

You can use the '@acronym' command for abbreviations written in all
capital letters, such as 'NASA'.  The abbreviation is given as the
single argument in braces, as in '@acronym{NASA}'.  As a matter of
style, or for particular acronyms, you may prefer to use periods, as in
'@acronym{N.A.S.A.}'.

   '@acronym' accepts an optional second argument, intended to be used
for the meaning of the acronym.

   If the acronym is at the end of a sentence, and if there is no second
argument, remember to use the '@.' or similar command (*note Ending a
Sentence::) to get the correct spacing.

   In TeX, the acronym is printed in slightly smaller font.  In the Info
output, the argument is printed as-is.  In either format, if the second
argument is present, it is printed in parentheses after the acronym.  In
HTML and Docbook the '<acronym>' tag is used.

   For instance (since GNU is a recursive acronym, we use '@acronym'
recursively):

     @acronym{GNU, @acronym{GNU}'s Not Unix}

produces:

     GNU (GNU's Not Unix)

   In some circumstances, it is conventional to print family names in
all capitals.  Don't use '@acronym' for this, since a name is not an
acronym.  Use '@sc' instead (*note Smallcaps::).

   '@abbr' and '@acronym' are closely related commands: they both signal
to the reader that a shortened form is being used, and possibly give a
meaning.  When choosing whether to use these two commands, please bear
the following in mind.

   - In common English usage, acronyms are a subset of abbreviations:
     they include pronounceable words like 'NATO', 'radar', and 'snafu';
     some sources also include syllable acronyms like 'Usenet', hybrids
     like 'SIGGRAPH', and unpronounceable initialisms like 'FBI'.

   - In Texinfo, an acronym (but not an abbreviation) should consist
     only of capital letters and periods, no lowercase.

   - In TeX, an acronym (but not an abbreviation) is printed in a
     slightly smaller font.

   - Some browsers place a dotted bottom border under abbreviations but
     not acronyms.

   - It usually turns out to be quite difficult and/or time-consuming to
     consistently use '@acronym' for all sequences of uppercase letters.
     Furthermore, it looks strange for some acronyms to be in the normal
     font size and others to be smaller.  Thus, a simpler approach you
     may wish to consider is to avoid '@acronym' and just typeset
     everything as normal text in all capitals: 'GNU', producing the
     output 'GNU'.

   - In general, it's not essential to use either of these commands for
     all abbreviations; use your judgment.  Text is perfectly readable
     without them.

7.1.15 '@indicateurl'{UNIFORM-RESOURCE-LOCATOR}
-----------------------------------------------

Use the '@indicateurl' command to indicate a uniform resource locator on
the World Wide Web.  This is purely for markup purposes and does not
produce a link you can follow (use the '@url' or '@uref' command for
that, *note @url::).  '@indicateurl' is useful for urls which do not
actually exist.  For example:

     For example, the url might be @indicateurl{http://example.org/path}.

which produces:

     For example, the url might be 'http://example.org/path'.

   The output from '@indicateurl' is more or less like that of '@samp'
(*note @samp::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @email,  Prev: @indicateurl,  Up: Indicating

7.1.16 '@email'{EMAIL-ADDRESS[, DISPLAYED-TEXT]}
------------------------------------------------

Use the '@email' command to indicate an electronic mail address.  It
takes one mandatory argument, the address, and one optional argument,
the text to display (the default is the address itself).

   In Info, the address is shown in angle brackets, preceded by the text
to display if any.  In TeX, the angle brackets are omitted.  In HTML
output, '@email' produces a 'mailto' link that usually brings up a mail
composition window.  For example:

     Send bug reports to @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org},
     suggestions to the @email{bug-texinfo@@gnu.org, same place}.

produces

     Send bug reports to <bug-texinfo@gnu.org>,
     suggestions to the same place <bug-texinfo@gnu.org>.

7.2 Emphasizing Text
====================

Usually, Texinfo changes the font to mark words in the text according to
the category the words belong to; an example is the '@code' command.
Most often, this is the best way to mark words.  However, sometimes you
will want to emphasize text without indicating a category.  Texinfo has
two commands to do this.  Also, Texinfo has several commands that
specify the font in which text will be output.  These commands have no
effect in Info and only one of them, the '@r' command, has any regular
use.

* Menu:

* @emph @strong::               How to emphasize text in Texinfo.
* Smallcaps::                   How to use the small caps font.
* Fonts::                       Various font commands for printed output.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @emph @strong,  Next: Smallcaps,  Up: Emphasis

7.2.1 '@emph'{TEXT} and '@strong'{TEXT}
---------------------------------------

The '@emph' and '@strong' commands are for emphasis; '@strong' is
stronger.  In printed output, '@emph' produces _italics_ and '@strong'
produces *bold*.  In the Info output, '@emph' surrounds the text with
underscores ('_'), and '@strong' puts asterisks around the text.

   For example,

     @strong{Caution:} @samp{rm * .[^.]*}
     removes @emph{all} files in the directory.

produces the following:

     *Caution*: 'rm * .[^.]*' removes _all_ files in the directory.

   The '@strong' command is seldom used except to mark what is, in
effect, a typographical element, such as the word 'Caution' in the
preceding example.

     Caution: Do not use '@strong' with the word 'Note' followed by a
     space; Info will mistake the combination for a cross-reference.
     Use a phrase such as *Please notice* or *Caution* instead, or the
     optional argument to '@quotation'--'Note' is allowable there.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Smallcaps,  Next: Fonts,  Prev: @emph @strong,  Up: Emphasis

7.2.2 '@sc'{TEXT}: The Small Caps Font
--------------------------------------

Use the '@sc' command to set text in A SMALL CAPS FONT (where possible).
Write the text you want to be in small caps between braces in lowercase,
like this:

     Richard @sc{Stallman} commencé GNU.

This produces:

     Richard STALLMAN commencé GNU.

   As shown here, we recommend reserving '@sc' for special cases where
you want typographic small caps; family names are one such, especially
in languages other than English, though there are no hard-and-fast rules
about such things.

   TeX typesets any uppercase letters between the braces of an '@sc'
command in full-size capitals; only lowercase letters are printed in the
small caps font.  In the Info output, the argument to '@sc' is printed
in all uppercase.  In HTML, the argument is uppercased and the output
marked with the '<small>' tag to reduce the font size, since HTML cannot
easily represent true small caps.

   Overall, we recommend using standard upper- and lowercase letters
wherever possible.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Fonts,  Prev: Smallcaps,  Up: Emphasis

7.2.3 Fonts for Printing
------------------------

Texinfo provides one command to change the size of the main body font in
the TeX output for a document: '@fonttextsize'.  It has no effect in
other output.  It takes a single argument on the remainder of the line,
which must be either '10' or '11'.  For example:

     @fonttextsize 10

   The effect is to reduce the body font to a 10pt size (the default is
11pt).  Fonts for other elements, such as sections and chapters, are
reduced accordingly.  This should only be used in conjunction with
'@smallbook' (*note @smallbook::) or similar, since 10pt fonts on
standard paper (8.5x11 or A4) are too small.  One reason to use this
command is to save pages, and hence printing cost, for physical books.

   Texinfo does not at present have commands to switch the font family
to use, or more general size-changing commands.

   Texinfo also provides a number of font commands that specify font
changes in the printed manual and (where possible) in the HTML output.
They have no effect in Info.  All the commands apply to a following
argument surrounded by braces.

'@b'
     selects bold face;

'@i'
     selects an italic font;

'@r'
     selects a roman font, which is the usual font in which text is
     printed.  It may or may not be seriffed.

'@sansserif'
     selects a sans serif font;

'@slanted'
     selects a slanted font;

'@t'
     selects the fixed-width, typewriter-style font used by '@code';

   (The commands with longer names were invented much later than the
others, at which time it did not seem desirable to use very short names
for such infrequently needed features.)

   The '@r' command can be useful in example-like environments, to write
comments in the standard roman font instead of the fixed-width font.
This looks better in printed output, and produces a '<lineannotation>'
tag in Docbook output.

   For example,

     @lisp
     (+ 2 2)    ; @r{Add two plus two.}
     @end lisp

produces

     (+ 2 2)    ; Add two plus two.

   The '@t' command can occasionally be useful to produce output in a
typewriter font where that is supported (e.g., HTML and PDF), but no
distinction is needed in Info or plain text: '@t{foo}' produces foo, cf.
'@code{foo}' producing 'foo'.

   In general, the other font commands are unlikely to be useful; they
exist primarily to make it possible to document the functionality of
specific font effects, such as in TeX and related packages.

8 Quotations and Examples
*************************

Quotations and examples are blocks of text consisting of one or more
whole paragraphs that are set off from the bulk of the text and treated
differently.  They are usually indented in the output.

   In Texinfo, you always begin a quotation or example by writing an
@-command at the beginning of a line by itself, and end it by writing an
'@end' command that is also at the beginning of a line by itself.  For
instance, you begin an example by writing '@example' by itself at the
beginning of a line and end the example by writing '@end example' on a
line by itself, at the beginning of that line, and with only one space
between the '@end' and the 'example'.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Block Enclosing Commands,  Next: @quotation,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.1 Block Enclosing Commands
============================

Here is a summary of commands that enclose blocks of text, also known as
"environments".  They're explained further in the following sections.

'@quotation'
     Indicate text that is quoted.  The text is filled, indented (from
     both margins), and printed in a roman font by default.

'@indentedblock'
     Like '@quotation', but the text is indented only on the left.

'@example'
     Illustrate code, commands, and the like.  The text is printed in a
     fixed-width font, and indented but not filled.

'@lisp'
     Like '@example', but specifically for illustrating Lisp code.  The
     text is printed in a fixed-width font, and indented but not filled.

'@verbatim'
     Mark a piece of text that is to be printed verbatim; no character
     substitutions are made and all commands are ignored, until the next
     '@end verbatim'.  The text is printed in a fixed-width font, and
     not indented or filled.  Extra spaces and blank lines are
     significant, and tabs are expanded.

'@display'
     Display illustrative text.  The text is indented but not filled,
     and no font is selected (so, by default, the font is roman).

'@format'
     Like '@display' (the text is not filled and no font is selected),
     but the text is not indented.

'@smallquotation'
'@smallindentedblock'
'@smallexample'
'@smalllisp'
'@smalldisplay'
'@smallformat'
     These '@small...' commands are just like their non-small
     counterparts, except that they output text in a smaller font size,
     where possible.

'@flushleft'
'@flushright'
     Text is not filled, but is set flush with the left or right margin,
     respectively.

'@raggedright'
     Text is filled, but only justified on the left, leaving the right
     margin ragged.

'@cartouche'
     Highlight text, often an example or quotation, by drawing a box
     with rounded corners around it.

   The '@exdent' command is used within the above constructs to undo the
indentation of a line.

   The '@noindent' command may be used after one of the above constructs
(or at the beginning of any paragraph) to prevent the following text
from being indented as a new paragraph.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @quotation,  Next: @indentedblock,  Prev: Block Enclosing Commands,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.2 '@quotation': Block Quotations
==================================

The text of a quotation is processed like normal text (regular font,
text is filled) except that:

   * both the left and right margins are closer to the center of the
     page, so the whole of the quotation is indented;

   * the first lines of paragraphs are indented no more than other
     lines; and

   * an '@author' command may be given to specify the author of the
     quotation.

     This is an example of text written between a '@quotation' command
     and an '@end quotation' command.  A '@quotation' command is most
     often used to indicate text that is excerpted from another (real or
     hypothetical) printed work.

   Write a '@quotation' command as text on a line by itself.  This line
will disappear from the output.  Mark the end of the quotation with a
line beginning with and containing only '@end quotation'.  The '@end
quotation' line will likewise disappear from the output.

   '@quotation' takes one optional argument, given on the remainder of
the line.  This text, if present, is included at the beginning of the
quotation in bold or otherwise emphasized, and followed with a ':'.  For
example:

     @quotation Note
     This is
     a foo.
     @end quotation

produces

     Note: This is a foo.

   If the '@quotation' argument is one of these English words
(case-insensitive):

     Caution  Important  Note  Tip  Warning

then the Docbook output uses corresponding special tags ('<note>', etc.)
instead of the default '<blockquote>'.  HTML output always uses
'<blockquote>'.

   If the author of the quotation is specified in the '@quotation' block
with the '@author' command, a line with the author name is displayed
after the quotation:

     @quotation
     People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the Church of Emacs to use
     vi.  Using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance.  So happy
     hacking.

     @author Richard Stallman
     @end quotation

produces

     People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the Church of Emacs to
     use vi.  Using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance.
     So happy hacking.

                         -- _Richard Stallman_

   Texinfo also provides a command '@smallquotation', which is just like
'@quotation' but uses a smaller font size where possible.  *Note
@small...::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @indentedblock,  Next: @example,  Prev: @quotation,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.3 '@indentedblock': Indented text blocks
==========================================

The '@indentedblock' environment is similar to '@quotation', except that
text is only indented on the left (and there is no optional argument for
an author).  Thus, the text font remains unchanged, and text is gathered
and filled as usual, but the left margin is increased.  For example:

     This is an example of text written between an '@indentedblock'
     command and an '@end indentedblock' command.  The '@indentedblock'
     environment can contain any text or other commands desired.

   This is written in the Texinfo source as:

     @indentedblock
     This is an example ...
     @end indentedblock

   Texinfo also provides a command '@smallindentedblock', which is just
like '@indentedblock' but uses a smaller font size where possible.
*Note @small...::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @example,  Next: @verbatim,  Prev: @indentedblock,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.4 '@example': Example Text
============================

The '@example' environment is used to indicate an example that is not
part of the running text, such as computer input or output.  Write an
'@example' command at the beginning of a line by itself.  Mark the end
of the example with an '@end example' command, also written at the
beginning of a line by itself.

   An '@example' environment has the following characteristics:

   * Each line in the input file is a line in the output; that is, the
     source text is not filled as it normally is.
   * Extra spaces and blank lines are significant.
   * The output is indented.
   * The output uses a fixed-width font.
   * Texinfo commands _are_ expanded; if you want the output to be the
     input verbatim, use the '@verbatim' environment instead (*note
     @verbatim::).

   For example,

     @example
     cp foo @var{dest1}; \
      cp foo @var{dest2}
     @end example

produces

     cp foo DEST1; \
      cp foo DEST2

   The lines containing '@example' and '@end example' will disappear
from the output.  To make the output look good, you should put a blank
line before the '@example' and another blank line after the '@end
example'.  Blank lines inside the beginning '@example' and the ending
'@end example', on the other hand, do appear in the output.

     Caution: Do not use tabs in the lines of an example!  (Or anywhere
     else in Texinfo, except in verbatim environments.)  TeX treats tabs
     as single spaces, and that is not what they look like.  In Emacs,
     you can use 'M-x untabify' to convert tabs in a region to multiple
     spaces.

   Examples are often, logically speaking, "in the middle" of a
paragraph, and the text that continues afterwards should not be
indented, as in the example above.  The '@noindent' command prevents a
piece of text from being indented as if it were a new paragraph (*note
@noindent::).

   If you want to embed code fragments within sentences, instead of
displaying them, use the '@code' command or its relatives (*note
@code::).

   If you wish to write a "comment" on a line of an example in the
normal roman font, you can use the '@r' command (*note Fonts::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @verbatim,  Next: @lisp,  Prev: @example,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.5 '@verbatim': Literal Text
=============================

Use the '@verbatim' environment for printing of text that may contain
special characters or commands that should not be interpreted, such as
computer input or output ('@example' interprets its text as regular
Texinfo commands).  This is especially useful for including
automatically generated files in a Texinfo manual.

   In general, the output will be just the same as the input.  No
character substitutions are made, e.g., all spaces and blank lines are
significant, including tabs.  In the printed manual, the text is typeset
in a fixed-width font, and not indented or filled.

   Write a '@verbatim' command at the beginning of a line by itself.
This line will disappear from the output.  Mark the end of the verbatim
block with an '@end verbatim' command, also written at the beginning of
a line by itself.  The '@end verbatim' will also disappear from the
output.

   For example:

@verbatim
{
<TAB>@command with strange characters: @'e
expand<TAB>me
}
@end verbatim

This produces:

{
        @command with strange characters: @'e
expand	me
}

   Since the lines containing '@verbatim' and '@end verbatim' produce no
output, typically you should put a blank line before the '@verbatim' and
another blank line after the '@end verbatim'.  Blank lines between the
beginning '@verbatim' and the ending '@end verbatim' will appear in the
output.

   You can get a "small" verbatim by enclosing the '@verbatim' in an
'@smallformat' environment, as shown here:

@smallformat
@verbatim
... still verbatim, but in a smaller font ...
@end verbatim
@end smallformat

   Finally, a word of warning: it is not reliable to use '@verbatim'
inside other Texinfo constructs.

   See also *note @verbatiminclude::.

8.6 '@lisp': Marking a Lisp Example
===================================

The '@lisp' command is used for Lisp code.  It is synonymous with the
'@example' command.

     This is an example of text written between an
     @lisp command and an @end lisp command.

   Use '@lisp' instead of '@example' to preserve information regarding
the nature of the example.  This is useful, for example, if you write a
function that evaluates only and all the Lisp code in a Texinfo file.
Then you can use the Texinfo file as a Lisp library.  Mark the end of
'@lisp' with '@end lisp' on a line by itself.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @display,  Next: @format,  Prev: @lisp,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.7 '@display': Examples Using the Text Font
============================================

The '@display' command begins another kind of environment, where the
font is left unchanged, not switched to typewriter as with '@example'.
Each line of input still produces a line of output, and the output is
still indented.

     This is an example of text written between a '@display' command
     and an '@end display' command.  The '@display' command
     indents the text, but does not fill it.

   Texinfo also provides the environment '@smalldisplay', which is like
'@display' but uses a smaller font size.  *Note @small...::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @format,  Next: @exdent,  Prev: @display,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.8 '@format': Examples Using the Full Line Width
=================================================

The '@format' command is similar to '@display', except it leaves the
text unindented.  Like '@display', it does not select the fixed-width
font.

This is an example of text written between a '@format' command
and an '@end format' command.  As you can see
from this example,
the '@format' command does not fill the text.

   Texinfo also provides the environment '@smallformat', which is like
'@format' but uses a smaller font size.  *Note @small...::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @exdent,  Next: @flushleft @flushright,  Prev: @format,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.9 '@exdent': Undoing a Line's Indentation
===========================================

The '@exdent' command removes any indentation a line might have.  The
command is written at the beginning of a line and applies only to the
text that follows the command that is on the same line.  Do not use
braces around the text.  In a printed manual, the text on an '@exdent'
line is printed in the roman font.

   '@exdent' is usually used within examples.  Thus,

     @example
     This line follows an @@example command.
     @exdent This line is exdented.
     This line follows the exdented line.
     The @@end example comes on the next line.
     @end example

produces

     This line follows an @example command.
This line is exdented.
     This line follows the exdented line.
     The @end example comes on the next line.

   In practice, the '@exdent' command is rarely used.  Usually, you
un-indent text by ending the example and returning the page to its
normal width.

   '@exdent' has no effect in HTML output.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @flushleft @flushright,  Next: @raggedright,  Prev: @exdent,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.10 '@flushleft' and '@flushright'
===================================

The '@flushleft' and '@flushright' commands line up the ends of lines on
the left and right margins of a page, but do not fill the text.  The
commands are written on lines of their own, without braces.  The
'@flushleft' and '@flushright' commands are ended by '@end flushleft'
and '@end flushright' commands on lines of their own.

   For example,

     @flushleft
     This text is
     written flushleft.
     @end flushleft

produces

     This text is
     written flushleft.

   '@flushright' produces the type of indentation often used in the
return address of letters.  For example,

     @flushright
     Here is an example of text written
     flushright.  The @code{@flushright} command
     right justifies every line but leaves the
     left end ragged.
     @end flushright

produces

                                     Here is an example of text written
                                 flushright.  The '@flushright' command
                              right justifies every line but leaves the
                                                       left end ragged.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @raggedright,  Next: @noindent,  Prev: @flushleft @flushright,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.11 '@raggedright': Ragged Right Text
======================================

The '@raggedright' fills text as usual, but the text is only justified
on the left; the right margin is ragged.  The command is written on a
line of its own, without braces.  The '@raggedright' command is ended by
'@end raggedright' on a line of its own.  This command has no effect in
Info and HTML output, where text is always set ragged right.

   The '@raggedright' command can be useful with paragraphs containing
lists of commands with long names, when it is known in advance that
justifying the text on both margins will make the paragraph look bad.

   An example (from elsewhere in this manual):

     @raggedright
     Commands for double and single angle quotation marks:
     @code{@@guillemetleft@{@}}, @code{@@guillemetright@{@}},
     @code{@@guillemotleft@{@}}, @code{@@guillemotright@{@}},
     @code{@@guilsinglleft@{@}}, @code{@@guilsinglright@{@}}.

8.12 '@noindent': Omitting Indentation
======================================

An example or other inclusion can break a paragraph into segments.
Ordinarily, the formatters indent text that follows an example as a new
paragraph.  You can prevent this on a case-by-case basis by writing
'@noindent' at the beginning of a line, preceding the continuation text.
You can also disable indentation for all paragraphs globally with
'@paragraphindent' (*note @paragraphindent::).

   Here is an example showing how to eliminate the normal indentation of
the text after an '@example', a common situation:

     @example
     This is an example
     @end example

     @noindent
     This line is not indented.  As you can see, the
     beginning of the line is fully flush left with the
     line that follows after it.

produces:

          This is an example

     This line is not indented.  As you can see, the
     beginning of the line is fully flush left with the
     line that follows after it.

   The standard usage of '@noindent' is just as above: at the beginning
of what would otherwise be a paragraph, to eliminate the indentation
that normally happens there.  It can either be followed by text or be on
a line by itself.  There is no reason to use it in other contexts, such
as in the middle of a paragraph or inside an environment (*note
Quotations and Examples::).

   You can control the number of blank lines in the Info file output by
adjusting the input as desired: a line containing just '@noindent' does
not generate a blank line, and neither does an '@end' line for an
environment.

   Do not put braces after a '@noindent' command; they are not used,
since '@noindent' is a command used outside of paragraphs (*note Command
Syntax::).

8.13 '@indent': Forcing Indentation
===================================

   To complement the '@noindent' command (see the previous section),
Texinfo provides the '@indent' command to force a paragraph to be
indented.  For instance, this paragraph (the first in this section) is
indented using an '@indent' command.

   And indeed, the first paragraph of a section is the most likely place
to use '@indent', to override the normal behavior of no indentation
there (*note @paragraphindent::).  It can either be followed by text or
be on a line by itself.

   As a special case, when '@indent' is used in an environment where
text is not filled, it produces a paragraph indentation space in the TeX
output.  (These environments are where a line of input produces a line
of output, such as '@example' and '@display'; for a summary of all
environments, *note Block Enclosing Commands::.)

   Do not put braces after an '@indent' command; they are not used,
since '@indent' is a command used outside of paragraphs (*note Command
Syntax::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @cartouche,  Next: @small...,  Prev: @indent,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.14 '@cartouche': Rounded Rectangles
=====================================

In a printed manual, the '@cartouche' command draws a box with rounded
corners around its contents.  In HTML, a normal rectangle is drawn.
'@cartouche' has no effect in Info output.

   You can use this command to further highlight an example or
quotation.  For instance, you could write a manual in which one type of
example is surrounded by a cartouche for emphasis.

   For example,

     @cartouche
     @example
     % pwd
     /usr/local/share/emacs
     @end example
     @end cartouche

surrounds the two-line example with a box with rounded corners, in the
printed manual.

   The output from the example looks like this (if you're reading this
in Info, you'll see the '@cartouche' had no effect):

     % pwd
     /usr/local/share/emacs

   '@cartouche' also implies '@group' (*note @group::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @small...,  Prev: @cartouche,  Up: Quotations and Examples

8.15 '@small...' Block Commands
===============================

In addition to the regular '@example' and similar commands, Texinfo has
"small" example-style commands.  These are '@smallquotation',
'@smallindentedblock', '@smalldisplay', '@smallexample', '@smallformat',
and '@smalllisp'.

   In Info and HTML output, the '@small...' commands are equivalent to
their non-small companion commands.

   In TeX, however, the '@small...' commands typeset text in a smaller
font than the non-small example commands.  Thus, for instance, code
examples can contain longer lines and still fit on a page without
needing to be rewritten.

   A smaller font size is also retained in the Texinfo XML
transliteration.

   Mark the end of a '@small...' block with a corresponding '@end
small...'.  For example, pair '@smallexample' with '@end smallexample'.

   Here is an example of the font used by the '@smallexample' command
(in Info, the output will be the same as usual):

     ... to make sure that you have the freedom to
     distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     this service if you wish), that you receive source
     code or can get it if you want it, that you can
     change the software or use pieces of it in new free
     programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   The '@small...' commands use the same font style as their normal
counterparts: '@smallexample' and '@smalllisp' use a fixed-width font,
and everything else uses the regular font.  They also have the same
behavior in other respects--whether filling is done and whether margins
are narrowed.

   As a general rule, a printed document looks better if you use only
one of (for instance) '@example' or '@smallexample' consistently within
a chapter.

9 Lists and Tables
******************

Texinfo has several ways of making lists and tables.  Lists can be
bulleted or numbered; two-column tables can highlight the items in the
first column; multi-column tables are also supported.

* Menu:

* Introducing Lists::           Texinfo formats lists for you.
* @itemize::                    How to construct a simple list.
* @enumerate::                  How to construct a numbered list.
* Two-column Tables::           How to construct a two-column table.
* Multi-column Tables::         How to construct generalized tables.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Introducing Lists,  Next: @itemize,  Up: Lists and Tables

9.1 Introducing Lists
=====================

Texinfo automatically indents the text in lists or tables, and numbers
an enumerated list.  This last feature is useful if you modify the list,
since you do not need to renumber it yourself.

   Numbered lists and tables begin with the appropriate @-command at the
beginning of a line, and end with the corresponding '@end' command on a
line by itself.  The table and itemized-list commands also require that
you write formatting information on the same line as the beginning
@-command.

   Begin an enumerated list, for example, with an '@enumerate' command
and end the list with an '@end enumerate' command.  Begin an itemized
list with an '@itemize' command, followed on the same line by a
formatting command such as '@bullet', and end the list with an '@end
itemize' command.

   Precede each element of a list with an '@item' or '@itemx' command.


Here is an itemized list of the different kinds of table and lists:

   * Itemized lists with and without bullets.

   * Enumerated lists, using numbers or letters.

   * Two-column tables with highlighting.


Here is an enumerated list with the same items:

  1. Itemized lists with and without bullets.

  2. Enumerated lists, using numbers or letters.

  3. Two-column tables with highlighting.


And here is a two-column table with the same items and their @-commands:

'@itemize'
     Itemized lists with and without bullets.

'@enumerate'
     Enumerated lists, using numbers or letters.

'@table'
'@ftable'
'@vtable'
     Two-column tables, optionally with indexing.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @itemize,  Next: @enumerate,  Prev: Introducing Lists,  Up: Lists and Tables

9.2 '@itemize': Making an Itemized List
=======================================

The '@itemize' command produces a sequence of "items", each starting
with a bullet or other mark inside the left margin, and generally
indented.

   Begin an itemized list by writing '@itemize' at the beginning of a
line.  Follow the command, on the same line, with a character or a
Texinfo command that generates a mark.  Usually, you will use '@bullet'
after '@itemize', but you can use '@minus', or any command or character
that results in a single character in the Info file.  (When you write
the mark command such as '@bullet' after an '@itemize' command, you may
omit the '{}'.)  If you don't specify a mark command, the default is
'@bullet'.  If you don't want any mark at all, but still want logical
items, use '@w{}' (in this case the braces are required).

   After the '@itemize', write your items, each starting with '@item'.
Text can follow on the same line as the '@item'.  The text of an item
can continue for more than one paragraph.

   There should be at least one '@item' inside the '@itemize'
environment.  If none are present, 'makeinfo' gives a warning.  If you
just want indented text and not a list of items, use '@indentedblock';
*note @indentedblock::.

   Index entries and comments that are given before an '@item' including
the first, are automatically moved (internally) to after the '@item', so
the output is as expected.  Historically this has been a common
practice.

   Usually, you should put a blank line between items.  This puts a
blank line in the Info file.  (TeX inserts the proper vertical space in
any case.)  Except when the entries are very brief, these blank lines
make the list look better.

   Here is an example of the use of '@itemize', followed by the output
it produces.  '@bullet' produces an '*' in Info and a round dot in other
output formats.

     @itemize @bullet
     @item
     Some text for foo.

     @item
     Some text
     for bar.
     @end itemize

This produces:

        * Some text for foo.

        * Some text for bar.

   Itemized lists may be embedded within other itemized lists.  Here is
a list marked with dashes embedded in a list marked with bullets:

     @itemize @bullet
     @item
     First item.

     @itemize @minus
     @item
     Inner item.

     @item
     Second inner item.
     @end itemize

     @item
     Second outer item.
     @end itemize

This produces:

        * First item.

             - Inner item.

             - Second inner item.

        * Second outer item.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @enumerate,  Next: Two-column Tables,  Prev: @itemize,  Up: Lists and Tables

9.3 '@enumerate': Making a Numbered or Lettered List
====================================================

'@enumerate' is like '@itemize' (*note @itemize::), except that the
labels on the items are successive integers or letters instead of
bullets.

   Write the '@enumerate' command at the beginning of a line.  The
command does not require an argument, but accepts either a number or a
letter as an option.  Without an argument, '@enumerate' starts the list
with the number '1'.  With a numeric argument, such as '3', the command
starts the list with that number.  With an upper- or lowercase letter,
such as 'a' or 'A', the command starts the list with that letter.

   Write the text of the enumerated list in the same way as an itemized
list: write a line starting with '@item' at the beginning of each item
in the enumeration.  It is ok to have text following the '@item', and
the text for an item can continue for several paragraphs.

   You should put a blank line between entries in the list.  This
generally makes it easier to read the Info file.

   Here is an example of '@enumerate' without an argument:

     @enumerate
     @item
     Underlying causes.

     @item
     Proximate causes.
     @end enumerate

This produces:

  1. Underlying causes.

  2. Proximate causes.

   Here is an example with an argument of '3':

     @enumerate 3
     @item
     Predisposing causes.

     @item
     Precipitating causes.

     @item
     Perpetuating causes.
     @end enumerate

This produces:

  3. Predisposing causes.

  4. Precipitating causes.

  5. Perpetuating causes.

   Here is a brief summary of the alternatives.  The summary is
constructed using '@enumerate' with an argument of 'a'.

  a. '@enumerate'

     Without an argument, produce a numbered list, with the first item
     numbered 1.

  b. '@enumerate UNSIGNED-INTEGER'

     With an (unsigned) numeric argument, start a numbered list with
     that number.  You can use this to continue a list that you
     interrupted with other text.

  c. '@enumerate UPPER-CASE-LETTER'

     With an uppercase letter as argument, start a list in which each
     item is marked by a letter, beginning with that uppercase letter.

  d. '@enumerate LOWER-CASE-LETTER'

     With a lowercase letter as argument, start a list in which each
     item is marked by a letter, beginning with that lowercase letter.

   You can also nest enumerated lists, as in an outline.

9.4 Making a Two-column Table
=============================

'@table' is similar to '@itemize' (*note @itemize::), but allows you to
specify a name or heading line for each item.  The '@table' command is
used to produce two-column tables, and is especially useful for
glossaries, explanatory exhibits, and command-line option summaries.

* Menu:

* @table::                      How to construct a two-column table.
* @ftable @vtable::             Automatic indexing for two-column tables.
* @itemx::                      How to put more entries in the first column.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @table,  Next: @ftable @vtable,  Up: Two-column Tables

9.4.1 Using the '@table' Command
--------------------------------

Use the '@table' command to produce a two-column table.  This command is
typically used when you have a list of items and a brief text with each
one, such as a list of definitions.

   Write the '@table' command at the beginning of a line, after a blank
line, and follow it on the same line with an argument that is an
'indicating' command, such as '@code', '@samp', '@var', '@option', or
'@kbd' (*note Indicating::).  This command will be applied to the text
in the first column.  For example, '@table @code' will cause the text in
the first column to be output as if it had been the argument to a
'@code' command.

   You may use the '@asis' command as an argument to '@table'.  '@asis'
is a command that does nothing: if you use this command after '@table',
the first column entries are output without added highlighting ("as
is").

   The '@table' command works with other commands besides those
explicitly mentioned here.  However, you can only use predefined Texinfo
commands that take an argument in braces.  You cannot reliably use a new
command defined with '@macro', although an '@alias' (for a suitable
predefined command) is acceptable.  *Note Defining New Texinfo
Commands::.

   Begin each table entry with an '@item' command at the beginning of a
line.  Write the text for the first column on the same line as the
'@item' command.  Write the text for the second column on the line
following the '@item' line and on subsequent lines.  You may write as
many lines of supporting text as you wish, even several paragraphs.  But
only the text on the same line as the '@item' will be placed in the
first column (including any footnotes).  You do not need to type
anything for an empty second column.

   Normally, you should put a blank line before an '@item' line (except
the first one).  This puts a blank line in the Info file.  Except when
the entries are very brief, a blank line looks better.  End the table
with a line consisting of '@end table', followed by a blank line.  TeX
will always start a new paragraph after the table, so the blank line is
needed for the Info output to be analogous.

   For example, the following table highlights the text in the first
column with the '@samp' command:

     @table @samp
     @item foo
     This is the text for
     @samp{foo}.

     @item bar
     Text for @samp{bar}.
     @end table

This produces:

'foo'
     This is the text for 'foo'.
'bar'
     Text for 'bar'.

   If you want to list two or more named items with a single block of
text, use the '@itemx' command.  (*Note @itemx::.)

   The '@table' command (*note @table::) is not supported inside
'@display'.  Since '@display' is line-oriented, it doesn't make sense to
use them together.  If you want to indent a table, try '@quotation'
(*note @quotation::) or '@indentedblock' (*note @indentedblock::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @ftable @vtable,  Next: @itemx,  Prev: @table,  Up: Two-column Tables

9.4.2 '@ftable' and '@vtable'
-----------------------------

The '@ftable' and '@vtable' commands are the same as the '@table'
command except that '@ftable' automatically enters each of the items in
the first column of the table into the index of functions and '@vtable'
automatically enters each of the items in the first column of the table
into the index of variables.  This simplifies the task of creating
indices.  Only the items on the same line as the '@item' or '@itemx'
commands are indexed, and they are indexed in exactly the form that they
appear on that line.  *Note Indices::, for more information about
indices.

   Begin a two-column table using '@ftable' or '@vtable' by writing the
@-command at the beginning of a line, followed on the same line by an
argument that is a Texinfo command such as '@code', exactly as you would
for a '@table' command; and end the table with an '@end ftable' or '@end
vtable' command on a line by itself.

   See the example for '@table' in the previous section.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @itemx,  Prev: @ftable @vtable,  Up: Two-column Tables

9.4.3 '@itemx': Second and Subsequent Items
-------------------------------------------

Use the '@itemx' command inside a table when you have two or more first
column entries for the same item, each of which should appear on a line
of its own.

   Use '@item' for the first entry, and '@itemx' for all subsequent
entries; '@itemx' must always follow an '@item' command, with no blank
line intervening.

   The '@itemx' command works exactly like '@item' except that it does
not generate extra vertical space above the first column text.  If you
have multiple consecutive '@itemx' commands, do not insert any blank
lines between them.

   For example,

     @table @code
     @item upcase
     @itemx downcase
     These two functions accept a character or a string as
     argument, and return the corresponding uppercase (lowercase)
     character or string.
     @end table

This produces:

'upcase'
'downcase'
     These two functions accept a character or a string as argument, and
     return the corresponding uppercase (lowercase) character or string.

(Note also that this example illustrates multi-line supporting text in a
two-column table.)


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Multi-column Tables,  Prev: Two-column Tables,  Up: Lists and Tables

9.5 '@multitable': Multi-column Tables
======================================

'@multitable' allows you to construct tables with any number of columns,
with each column having any width you like.

   You define the column widths on the '@multitable' line itself, and
write each row of the actual table following an '@item' command, with
columns separated by a '@tab' command.  Finally, '@end multitable'
completes the table.  Details in the sections below.

* Menu:

* Multitable Column Widths::    Defining multitable column widths.
* Multitable Rows::             Defining multitable rows, with examples.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Multitable Column Widths,  Next: Multitable Rows,  Up: Multi-column Tables

9.5.1 Multitable Column Widths
------------------------------

You can define the column widths for a multitable in two ways: as
fractions of the line length; or with a prototype row.  Mixing the two
methods is not supported.  In either case, the widths are defined
entirely on the same line as the '@multitable' command.

  1. To specify column widths as fractions of the line length, write
     '@columnfractions' and the decimal numbers (presumably less than 1;
     a leading zero is allowed and ignored) after the '@multitable'
     command, as in:

          @multitable @columnfractions .33 .33 .33

     The fractions need not add up exactly to 1.0, as these do not.
     This allows you to produce tables that do not need the full line
     length.

  2. To specify a prototype row, write the longest entry for each column
     enclosed in braces after the '@multitable' command.  For example:

          @multitable {some text for column one} {for column two}

     The first column will then have the width of the typeset 'some text
     for column one', and the second column the width of 'for column
     two'.

     The prototype entries need not appear in the table itself.

     Although we used simple text in this example, the prototype entries
     can contain Texinfo commands; markup commands such as '@code' are
     particularly likely to be useful.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Multitable Rows,  Prev: Multitable Column Widths,  Up: Multi-column Tables

9.5.2 Multitable Rows
---------------------

After the '@multitable' command defining the column widths (see the
previous section), you begin each row in the body of a multitable with
'@item', and separate the column entries with '@tab'.  Line breaks are
not special within the table body, and you may break input lines in your
source file as necessary.

   You can also use '@headitem' instead of '@item' to produce a "heading
row".  The TeX output for such a row is in bold, and the HTML and
Docbook output uses the '<thead>' tag.  In Info, the heading row is
followed by a separator line made of dashes ('-' characters).

   The command '@headitemfont' can be used in templates when the entries
in a '@headitem' row need to be used in a template.  It is a synonym for
'@b', but using '@headitemfont' avoids any dependency on that particular
font style, in case we provide a way to change it in the future.

   Here is a complete example of a multi-column table (the text is from
'The GNU Emacs Manual', *note Splitting Windows: (emacs)Split Window.):

     @multitable @columnfractions .15 .45 .4
     @headitem Key @tab Command @tab Description
     @item C-x 2
     @tab @code{split-window-vertically}
     @tab Split the selected window into two windows,
     with one above the other.
     @item C-x 3
     @tab @code{split-window-horizontally}
     @tab Split the selected window into two windows
     positioned side by side.
     @item C-Mouse-2
     @tab
     @tab In the mode line or scroll bar of a window,
     split that window.
     @end multitable

produces:

C-x 3       'split-window-horizontally'      Split the selected window
                                             into two windows positioned
                                             side by side.

10 Special Displays
*******************

The commands in this chapter allow you to write text that is specially
displayed (output format permitting), outside of the normal document
flow.

   One set of such commands is for creating "floats", that is, figures,
tables, and the like, set off from the main text, possibly numbered,
captioned, and/or referred to from elsewhere in the document.  Images
are often included in these displays.

   Another group of commands is for creating footnotes in Texinfo.

* Menu:

* Floats::                      Figures, tables, and the like.
* Images::                      Including graphics and images.
* Footnotes::                   Writing footnotes.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Floats,  Next: Images,  Up: Special Displays

10.1 Floats
===========

A "float" is a display which is set off from the main text.  It is
typically labeled as being a "Figure", "Table", "Example", or some
similar type.

   A float is so-named because, in principle, it can be moved to the
bottom or top of the current page, or to a following page, in the
printed output.  (Floating does not make sense in other output formats.)
In the present version of Texinfo, however, this floating is
unfortunately not yet implemented.  Instead, the floating material is
simply output at the current location, more or less as if it were an
'@group' (*note @group::).

* Menu:

* @float::                      Producing floating material.
* @caption @shortcaption::      Specifying descriptions for floats.
* @listoffloats::               A table of contents for floats.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @float,  Next: @caption @shortcaption,  Up: Floats

10.1.1 '@float' [TYPE][,LABEL]: Floating Material
-------------------------------------------------

To produce floating material, enclose the material you want to be
displayed separate between '@float' and '@end float' commands, on lines
by themselves.

   Floating material often uses '@image' to display an already-existing
graphic (*note Images::), or '@multitable' to display a table (*note
Multi-column Tables::).  However, the contents of the float can be
anything.  Here's an example with simple text:

     @float Figure,fig:ex1
     This is an example float.
     @end float

And the output:

This is an example float.

Figure 10.1

   As shown in the example, '@float' takes two arguments (separated by a
comma), TYPE and LABEL.  Both are optional.

TYPE
     Specifies the sort of float this is; typically a word such as
     "Figure", "Table", etc.  If this is not given, and LABEL is, any
     cross-referencing will simply use a bare number.

LABEL
     Specifies a cross-reference label for this float.  If given, this
     float is automatically given a number, and will appear in any
     '@listoffloats' output (*note @listoffloats::).  Cross references
     to LABEL are allowed.

     On the other hand, if LABEL is not given, then the float will not
     be numbered and consequently will not appear in the '@listoffloats'
     output or be cross-referenceable.

Ordinarily, you specify both TYPE and LABEL, to get a labeled and
numbered float.

   In Texinfo, all floats are numbered in the same way: with the chapter
number (or appendix letter), a period, and the float number, which
simply counts 1, 2, 3, ..., and is reset at each chapter.  Each float
type is counted independently.

   Floats within an '@unnumbered', or outside of any chapter, are simply
numbered consecutively from 1.

   These numbering conventions are not, at present, changeable.

10.1.2 '@caption' & '@shortcaption'
-----------------------------------

You may write a '@caption' anywhere within a '@float' environment, to
define a caption for the float.  It is not allowed in any other context.
'@caption' takes a single argument, enclosed in braces.  Here's an
example:

     @float
     An example float, with caption.
     @caption{Caption for example float.}
     @end float

The output is:

An example float, with caption.

Caption for example float.

   '@caption' can appear anywhere within the float; it is not processed
until the '@end float'.  The caption text is usually a sentence or two,
but may consist of several paragraphs if necessary.

   In the output, the caption always appears below the float; this is
not currently changeable.  It is preceded by the float type and/or
number, as specified to the '@float' command (see the previous section).

   The '@shortcaption' command likewise may be used only within
'@float', and takes a single argument in braces.  The short caption text
is used instead of the caption text in a list of floats (see the next
section).  Thus, you can write a long caption for the main document, and
a short title to appear in the list of floats.  For example:

     @float
     ... as above ...
     @shortcaption{Text for list of floats.}
     @end float

   The text for '@shortcaption' may not contain comments ('@c'),
verbatim text ('@verb'), environments such as '@example', footnotes
('@footnote') or other complex constructs.  The same constraints apply
to '@caption' unless there is a '@shortcaption'.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @listoffloats,  Prev: @caption @shortcaption,  Up: Floats

10.1.3 '@listoffloats': Tables of Contents for Floats
-----------------------------------------------------

You can write a '@listoffloats' command to generate a list of floats for
a given float type (*note @float::), analogous to the document's overall
table of contents.  Typically, it is written in its own '@unnumbered'
node to provide a heading and structure, rather like '@printindex'
(*note Printing Indices & Menus::).

   '@listoffloats' takes one optional argument, the float type.  Here's
an example:

     @node List of Figures
     @unnumbered List of Figures
     @listoffloats Figure

And here's what the output from '@listoffloats' looks like, given the
example figure earlier in this chapter (the Info output is formatted as
a menu):

     *      Figure 12.1:      fig:ex1.

   Without any argument, '@listoffloats' generates a list of floats for
which no float type was specified, i.e., no first argument to the
'@float' command (*note @float::).

   Each line in the list of floats contains the float type (if any), the
float number, and the caption, if any--the '@shortcaption' argument, if
it was specified, else the '@caption' argument.  In Info, the result is
a menu where each float can be selected.  In HTML, each line is a link
to the float.  In printed output, the page number is included.

   Unnumbered floats (those without cross-reference labels) are omitted
from the list of floats.

10.2 Inserting Images
=====================

You can insert an image given in an external file with the '@image'
command.  Although images can be used anywhere, including the middle of
a paragraph, we describe them in this chapter since they are most often
part of a displayed figure or example.

* Menu:

* Image Syntax::
* Image Scaling::


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Image Syntax,  Next: Image Scaling,  Up: Images

10.2.1 Image Syntax
-------------------

Here is the synopsis of the '@image' command:

     @image{FILENAME[, WIDTH[, HEIGHT[, ALTTEXT[, EXTENSION]]]]}

   The FILENAME argument is mandatory, and must not have an extension,
because the different processors support different formats:

   * TeX (DVI output) reads the file 'FILENAME.eps' (Encapsulated
     PostScript format).

   * pdfTeX reads 'FILENAME.pdf', 'FILENAME.png', 'FILENAME.jpg', or
     'FILENAME.jpeg' (in that order).  It also tries uppercase versions
     of the extensions.  The PDF format does not support EPS images, so
     such must be converted first.

   * For Info, 'makeinfo' includes 'FILENAME.txt' verbatim (more or less
     as if it were in '@verbatim').  The Info output may also include a
     reference to 'FILENAME.png' or 'FILENAME.jpg'.  (See below.)

   * For HTML, 'makeinfo' outputs a reference to 'FILENAME.png',
     'FILENAME.jpg', 'FILENAME.jpeg' or 'FILENAME.gif' (in that order).
     If none of those exist, it gives an error, and outputs a reference
     to 'FILENAME.jpg' anyway.

   * For Docbook, 'makeinfo' outputs references to 'FILENAME.eps',
     'FILENAME.gif' 'FILENAME.jpeg', 'FILENAME.jpg', 'FILENAME.pdf',
     'FILENAME.png' and 'FILENAME.svg', for every file found.  Also,
     'FILENAME.txt' is included verbatim, if present.  (The subsequent
     Docbook processor is supposed to choose the appropriate one.)

   * For Info and HTML output, 'makeinfo' uses the optional fifth
     argument EXTENSION to '@image' for the filename extension, if it is
     specified and the file is found.  Any leading period should be
     included in EXTENSION.  For example:

          @image{foo,,,,.xpm}

   If you want to install image files for use by Info readers too, we
recommend putting them in a subdirectory like 'FOO-figures' for a
package FOO.  Copying the files into '$(infodir)/FOO-figures/' should be
done in your 'Makefile'.

   The WIDTH and HEIGHT arguments are described in the next section.

   For TeX output, if an image is the only thing in a paragraph it will
ordinarily be displayed on a line by itself, respecting the current
environment indentation, but without the normal paragraph indentation.
If you want it centered, use '@center' (*note @titlefont @center @sp::).

   For HTML output, 'makeinfo' sets the "alt attribute" for inline
images to the optional ALTTEXT (fourth) argument to '@image', if
supplied.  If not supplied, 'makeinfo' uses the full file name of the
image being displayed.  The ALTTEXT is processed as Texinfo text, so
special characters such as '"' and '<' and '&' are escaped in the HTML
output; also, you can get an empty 'alt' string with '@-' (a command
that produces no output; *note @- @hyphenation::).

   For Info output, the 'alt' string is also processed as Texinfo text
and output.  In this case, '\' is escaped as '\\' and '"' as '\"'; no
other escapes are done.

   In Info output, 'makeinfo' writes a reference to the binary image
file (trying FILENAME suffixed with 'EXTENSION', '.EXTENSION', '.png',
or '.jpg', in that order) if one exists.  It also literally includes the
'.txt' file if one exists.  This way, Info readers which can display
images (such as the Emacs Info browser, running under X) can do so,
whereas Info readers which can only use text (such as the standalone
Info reader) can display the textual version.

   The implementation of this is to put the following construct into the
Info output:

     ^@^H[image src="BINARYFILE" text="TXTFILE"
                alt="ALTTEXT ... ^@^H]

where '^@' and '^H' stand for the actual null and backspace control
characters.  If one of the files is not present, the corresponding
argument is omitted.

   The reason for mentioning this here is that older Info browsers (this
feature was introduced in Texinfo version 4.6) will display the above
literally, which, although not pretty, should not be harmful.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Image Scaling,  Prev: Image Syntax,  Up: Images

10.2.2 Image Scaling
--------------------

The optional WIDTH and HEIGHT arguments to the '@image' command (see the
previous section) specify the size to which to scale the image.  They
are only taken into account in TeX.  If neither is specified, the image
is presented in its natural size (given in the file); if only one is
specified, the other is scaled proportionately; and if both are
specified, both are respected, thus likely distorting the original image
by changing its aspect ratio.

   The WIDTH and HEIGHT may be specified using any valid TeX dimension,
namely:

pt
     point (72.27pt = 1in)
pc
     pica (1pc = 12pt)
bp
     big point (72bp = 1in)
in
     inch
cm
     centimeter (2.54cm = 1in)
mm
     millimeter (10mm = 1cm)
dd
     didôt point (1157dd = 1238pt)
cc
     cicero (1cc = 12dd)
sp
     scaled point (65536sp = 1pt)

   For example, the following will scale a file 'ridt.eps' to one inch
vertically, with the width scaled proportionately:

     @image{ridt,,1in}

   For '@image' to work with TeX, the file 'epsf.tex' must be installed
somewhere that TeX can find it.  (The standard location is
'TEXMF/tex/generic/dvips/epsf.tex', where TEXMF is a root of your TeX
directory tree.)  This file is included in the Texinfo distribution and
is also available from <ftp://tug.org/tex/epsf.tex>, among other places.

   '@image' can be used within a line as well as for displayed figures.
Therefore, if you intend it to be displayed, be sure to leave a blank
line before the command, or the output will run into the preceding text.

   Image scaling is presently implemented only in TeX, not in HTML or
any other sort of output.

10.3 Footnotes
==============

A "footnote" is for a reference that documents or elucidates the primary
text.(1)

   Footnotes are distracting; use them sparingly at most, and it is best
to avoid them completely.  Standard bibliographical references are
usually better placed in a bibliography at the end of a document instead
of in footnotes throughout.

* Menu:

* Footnote Commands::           How to write a footnote in Texinfo.
* Footnote Styles::             Controlling how footnotes appear in Info.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) A footnote should complement or expand upon the primary text, but
a reader should not need to read a footnote to understand the primary
text.  For a thorough discussion of footnotes, see 'The Chicago Manual
of Style', which is published by the University of Chicago Press.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Footnote Commands,  Next: Footnote Styles,  Up: Footnotes

10.3.1 Footnote Commands
------------------------

In Texinfo, footnotes are created with the '@footnote' command.  This
command is followed immediately by a left brace, then by the text of the
footnote, and then by a terminating right brace.  Footnotes may be of
any length (they will be broken across pages if necessary), but are
usually short.  The template is:

     ordinary text@footnote{TEXT OF FOOTNOTE}

   As shown here, the '@footnote' command should come right after the
text being footnoted, with no intervening space; otherwise, the footnote
marker might end up starting a line.

   For example, this clause is followed by a sample footnote(1); in the
Texinfo source, it looks like this:

     ...a sample footnote@footnote{Here is the sample
     footnote.}; in the Texinfo source...

   As you can see, this source includes two punctuation marks next to
each other; in this case, '.};' is the sequence.  This is normal (the
first ends the footnote and the second belongs to the sentence being
footnoted), so don't worry that it looks odd.  (Another style, perfectly
acceptable, is to put the footnote after punctuation belonging to the
sentence, as in ';@footnote{...'.)

   In a printed manual or book, the reference mark for a footnote is a
small, superscripted number; the text of the footnote appears at the
bottom of the page, below a horizontal line.

   In Info, the reference mark for a footnote is a pair of parentheses
with the footnote number between them, like this: '(1)'.  The reference
mark is followed by a cross-reference link to the footnote text if
footnotes are put in separate nodes (*note Footnote Styles::).

   In the HTML output, footnote references are generally marked with a
small, superscripted number which is rendered as a hypertext link to the
footnote text.

   Footnotes cannot be nested, and cannot appear in section headings of
any kind or other "unusual" places.

   A final tip: footnotes in the argument of an '@item' command for an
'@table' must be entirely on the same line as the '@item' (as usual).
*Note Two-column Tables::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Here is the sample footnote.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Footnote Styles,  Prev: Footnote Commands,  Up: Footnotes

10.3.2 Footnote Styles
----------------------

Info has two footnote styles, which determine where the text of the
footnote is located:

   * In the 'End' node style, all the footnotes for a single node are
     placed at the end of that node.  The footnotes are separated from
     the rest of the node by a line of dashes with the word 'Footnotes'
     within it.  Each footnote begins with an '(N)' reference mark.

     Here is an example of the Info output for a single footnote in the
     end-of-node style:

          --------- Footnotes ---------

          (1)  Here is a sample footnote.

   * In the 'Separate' node style, all the footnotes for a single node
     are placed in an automatically constructed node of their own.  In
     this style, a "footnote reference" follows each '(N)' reference
     mark in the body of the node.  The footnote reference is actually a
     cross-reference which you use to reach the footnote node.

     The name of the node with the footnotes is constructed by appending
     '-Footnotes' to the name of the node that contains the footnotes.
     (Consequently, the footnotes' node for the 'Footnotes' node is
     'Footnotes-Footnotes'!)  The footnotes' node has an 'Up' node
     pointer that leads back to its parent node.

     Here is how the first footnote in this manual looks after being
     formatted for Info in the separate node style:

          File: texinfo.info  Node: Overview-Footnotes, Up: Overview

          (1) The first syllable of "Texinfo" is pronounced like "speck", not
          "hex". ...

   Unless your document has long and important footnotes (as in, say,
Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall ...'), we recommend the 'end' style, as it is
simpler for readers to follow.

   Use the '@footnotestyle' command to specify an Info file's footnote
style.  Write this command at the beginning of a line followed by an
argument, either 'end' for the end node style or 'separate' for the
separate node style.

   For example,

     @footnotestyle end
or
     @footnotestyle separate

   Write a '@footnotestyle' command before or shortly after the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.  (You should
include any '@footnotestyle' command between the start-of-header and
end-of-header lines, so the region formatting commands will format
footnotes as specified.)

   In HTML, when the footnote style is 'end', or if the output is not
split, footnotes are put at the end of the output.  If set to
'separate', and the output is split, they are placed in a separate file.

11 Indices
**********

Using Texinfo, you can generate indices without having to sort and
collate entries manually.  In an index, the entries are listed in
alphabetical order, together with information on how to find the
discussion of each entry.  In a printed manual, this information
consists of page numbers.  In an Info file, this information is a menu
entry leading to the first node referenced.

   Texinfo provides several predefined kinds of indices: an index for
functions, an index for variables, an index for concepts, and so on.
You can combine indices or use them for other than their canonical
purpose.  Lastly, you can define your own new indices.

                                 of entries.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Predefined Indices,  Next: Indexing Commands,  Up: Indices

11.1 Predefined Indices
=======================

Texinfo provides six predefined indices.  Here are their nominal
meanings, abbreviations, and the corresponding index entry commands:

'cp'
     ('@cindex') Concept index, for general concepts.
'fn'
     ('@findex') Function index, for function and function-like names
     (such as entry points of libraries).
'ky'
     ('@kindex') Keystroke index, for keyboard commands.
'pg'
     ('@pindex') Program index, for names of programs.
'tp'
     ('@tindex') Data type index, for type names (such as structures
     defined in header files).
'vr'
     ('@vindex') Variable index, for variable names (such as library
     global variables).

Not every manual needs all of these, and most manuals use only two or
three at most.  The present manual, for example, has two indices: a
concept index and an @-command index.  (The latter is actually the
function index but is called a command index in the chapter heading.)

   You are not required to use the predefined indices strictly for their
canonical purposes.  For example, suppose you wish to index some C
preprocessor macros.  You could put them in the function index along
with actual functions, just by writing '@findex' commands for them;
then, when you print the "Function Index" as an unnumbered chapter, you
could give it the title 'Function and Macro Index' and all will be
consistent for the reader.

   On the other hand, it is best not to stray too far from the meaning
of the predefined indices.  Otherwise, in the event that your text is
combined with other text from other manuals, the index entries will not
match up.  Instead, define your own new index (*note New Indices::).

   We recommend having a single index in the final document whenever
possible, however many source indices you use, since then readers have
only one place to look.  Two or more source indices can be combined into
one output index by using the '@synindex' or '@syncodeindex' commands
(*note Combining Indices::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Indexing Commands,  Next: Advanced Indexing,  Prev: Predefined Indices,  Up: Indices

11.2 Defining the Entries of an Index
=====================================

The data to make an index come from many individual indexing commands
scattered throughout the Texinfo source file.  Each command says to add
one entry to a particular index; after formatting, the index will give
the current page number or node name as the reference.

   An index entry consists of an indexing command at the beginning of a
line followed, on the rest of the line, by the entry.

   For example, this section begins with the following five entries for
the concept index:

     @cindex Defining indexing entries
     @cindex Index entries, defining
     @cindex Entries for an index
     @cindex Specifying index entries
     @cindex Creating index entries

   Each predefined index has its own indexing command--'@cindex' for the
concept index, '@findex' for the function index, and so on, as listed in
the previous section.

   Index entries should precede the visible material that is being
indexed.  For instance:

     @cindex hello
     Hello, there!

Among other reasons, that way following indexing links (in whatever
context) ends up before the material, where readers want to be, instead
of after.

   Try to avoid using a colon in index entries, as this may confuse some
Info readers.  *Note Menu Parts:: for more information about the
structure of a menu entry.

   By default, entries for a concept index are printed in a small roman
font and entries for the other indices are printed in a small '@code'
font.  You may change the way part of an entry is printed with the usual
Texinfo commands, such as '@file' for file names (*note Marking Text::),
and '@r' for the normal roman font (*note Fonts::).

   For the printed output, you may specify an explicit sort key for an
index entry using '@sortas' following either the index command or the
text of the entry.  For example: '@findex @sortas{\} \ @r{(literal \ in
@code{@@math})' sorts the index entry this produces under backslash.

   To reduce the quantity of sort keys you need to provide explicitly,
you may choose to ignore certain characters in index entries for the
purposes of sorting.  The characters that you can currently choose to
ignore are '\', '-', '<' and '@', which are ignored by giving as an
argument to the '@set' command, respectively, 'txiindexbackslashignore',
'txiindexhyphenignore', 'txiindexlessthanignore' and
'txiindexatsignignore'.  For example, specifying '@set
txiindexbackslashignore' causes the '\mathopsup' entry in the index for
this manual to be sorted as if it were 'mathopsup', so that it appears
among the other entries beginning with 'M'.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Advanced Indexing,  Next: Index Entries,  Prev: Indexing Commands,  Up: Indices

11.3 Advanced Indexing Commands
===============================

Texinfo provides several commands for doing advanced indexing, similar
to the indices you may see in professionally published books.

   First, you can create "multilevel" index entries, allowing you to
group many related subtopics under the same higher level topic.  You do
this by separating the parts of such an entry with the '@subentry'
command.  Such commands might look like this:

     @cindex Superhumans @subentry villians
     @cindex Superhumans @subentry heros

   You may have up to three levels in an entry:

     @cindex coffee makers @subentry electric @subentry pink
     @cindex coffee makers @subentry electric @subentry blue

   You can use the '@sortas' command mentioned earlier with any or all
of the three parts of an entry to cause them to sort differently than
they would by default.

   Second, you may provide an index entry that points to another, using
the '@seeentry' ("see entry") command.  For example:

     @cindex Indexes @seeentry{Indices}

   Such an entry should be unique in your document; the idea is to
redirect the reader to the other entry where they will find all the
information they are looking for.

   Finally, you may provide a "see also" entry using the '@seealso'
command.  These entries go along with regular entries, and are grouped
together with them in the final printed index.  For example:

     @cindex Coffee
     @cindex Coffee @subentry With milk and sugar
     @cindex Coffee @subentry With doughnuts
     @cindex Coffee @subentry Decaffeinated
     @cindex Coffee @seealso{Tea}

   When using all three of these advanced commands, _do not_ place a
comma betwen the different parts of the index text.  The 'texindex'
program, which sorts the index entries and generates the indexing
formatting commands, takes care of placing commas in the correct places
for you.

   These features are most useful with printed documents created with
TeX, and when translating Texinfo to Docbook.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Index Entries,  Next: Printing Indices & Menus,  Prev: Advanced Indexing,  Up: Indices

11.4 Making Index Entries
=========================

Concept index entries consist of text.  The best way to write an index
is to devise entries which are terse yet clear.  If you can do this, the
index usually looks better if the entries are written just as they would
appear in the middle of a sentence, that is, capitalizing only proper
names and acronyms that always call for uppercase letters.  This is the
case convention we use in most GNU manuals' indices.

   If you don't see how to make an entry terse yet clear, make it longer
and clear--not terse and confusing.  If many of the entries are several
words long, the index may look better if you use a different convention:
capitalize the first word of each entry.  Whichever case convention you
use, use it consistently.

   In any event, do not ever capitalize a case-sensitive name such as a
C or Lisp function name or a shell command; that would be a spelling
error.  Entries in indices other than the concept index are symbol names
in programming languages, or program names; these names are usually
case-sensitive, so likewise use upper- and lowercase as required.

   It is a good idea to make index entries unique wherever feasible.
That way, people using the printed output or online completion of index
entries don't see undifferentiated lists.  Consider this an opportunity
to make otherwise-identical index entries be more specific, so readers
can more easily find the exact place they are looking for.  The advanced
indexing features described in *note Advanced Indexing:: can help with
this, as well.

   When you are making index entries, it is good practice to think of
the different ways people may look for something.  Different people _do
not_ think of the same words when they look something up.  A helpful
index will have items indexed under all the different words that people
may use.  For example, one reader may think it obvious that the
two-letter names for indices should be listed under "Indices, two-letter
names", since "Indices" are the general concept.  But another reader may
remember the specific concept of two-letter names and search for the
entry listed as "Two letter names for indices".  A good index will have
both entries and will help both readers.

   Like typesetting, the construction of an index is a skilled art, the
subtleties of which may not be appreciated until you need to do it
yourself.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Printing Indices & Menus,  Next: Combining Indices,  Prev: Index Entries,  Up: Indices

11.5 Printing Indices and Menus
===============================

To print an index means to include it as part of a manual or Info file.
This does not happen automatically just because you use '@cindex' or
other index-entry generating commands in the Texinfo file; those just
cause the raw data for the index to be accumulated.  To generate an
index, you must include the '@printindex' command at the place in the
document where you want the index to appear.  Also, as part of the
process of creating a printed manual, you must run a program called
'texindex' (*note Hardcopy::) to sort the raw data to produce a sorted
index file.  The sorted index file is what is actually used to print the
index.

   Texinfo offers six separate types of predefined index, which suffice
in most cases.  See the other parts of this chapter for information on
this, as well as advanced indexing commands, defining your own new
indices, combining indices, and, most importantly, advice on writing the
actual index entries.  This section focuses on printing indices, which
is done with the '@printindex' command.

   '@printindex' takes one argument, a two-letter index abbreviation.
It reads the corresponding sorted index file (for printed output), and
formats it appropriately into an index.

   The '@printindex' command does not generate a chapter heading for the
index, since different manuals have different needs.  Consequently, you
should precede the '@printindex' command with a suitable section or
chapter command (usually '@appendix' or '@unnumbered') to supply the
chapter heading and put the index into the table of contents.  Precede
the chapter heading with an '@node' line as usual.

   For example:

     @node Variable Index
     @unnumbered Variable Index

     @printindex vr

     @node Concept Index
     @unnumbered Concept Index

     @printindex cp

   If you have more than one index, we recommend placing the concept
index last.

   * In printed output, '@printindex' produces a traditional two-column
     index, with dot leaders between the index terms and page numbers.

   * In Info output, '@printindex' produces a special menu containing
     the line number of the entry, relative to the start of the node.
     Info readers can use this to go to the exact line of an entry, not
     just the containing node.  (Older Info readers will just go to the
     node.)  Here's an example:

          * First index entry:   Top.   (line  7)

     The actual number of spaces is variable, to right-justify the line
     number; it's been reduced here to make the line fit in the printed
     manual.

   * In plain text output, '@printindex' produces the same menu, but the
     line numbers are relative to the start of the file, since that's
     more convenient for that format.

   * In HTML output, '@printindex' produces links to the index entries.

   * In XML and Docbook output, it simply records the index to be
     printed.

11.6 Combining Indices
======================

Sometimes you will want to combine two disparate indices such as
functions and concepts, perhaps because you have few enough entries that
a separate index would look silly.

   You could put functions into the concept index by writing '@cindex'
commands for them instead of '@findex' commands, and produce a
consistent manual by printing the concept index with the title 'Function
and Concept Index' and not printing the 'Function Index' at all; but
this is not a robust procedure.  It works only if your document is never
included as part of another document that is designed to have a separate
function index; if your document were to be included with such a
document, the functions from your document and those from the other
would not end up together.  Also, to make your function names appear in
the right font in the concept index, you would need to enclose every one
of them between the braces of '@code'.

* Menu:

* @syncodeindex::               How to merge two indices, using '@code'
                                 font for the merged-from index.
* @synindex::                   How to merge two indices, using the

11.6.1 '@syncodeindex': Combining Indices Using '@code'
-------------------------------------------------------

When you want to combine functions and concepts into one index, you
should index the functions with '@findex' and index the concepts with
'@cindex', and use the '@syncodeindex' command to redirect the function
index entries into the concept index.

   The '@syncodeindex' command takes two arguments; they are the name of
the index to redirect, and the name of the index to redirect it to.  The
template looks like this:

     @syncodeindex FROM TO

   For this purpose, the indices are given two-letter names:

'cp'
     Concept index
'fn'
     Function index
'ky'
     Key index
'pg'
     Program index
'tp'
     Data type index
'vr'
     Variable index

   Write a '@syncodeindex' command before or shortly after the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file.  For example, to
merge a function index with a concept index, write the following:

     @syncodeindex fn cp

This causes all entries designated for the function index to merge in
with the concept index instead.

   To merge both a variables index and a function index into a concept
index, write the following:

     @syncodeindex vr cp
     @syncodeindex fn cp

   The '@syncodeindex' command puts all the entries from the 'from'
index (the redirected index) into the '@code' font, overriding whatever
default font is used by the index to which the entries are now directed.
This way, if you direct function names from a function index into a
concept index, all the function names are printed in the '@code' font as
you would expect.

11.6.2 '@synindex': Combining Indices
-------------------------------------

The '@synindex' command is nearly the same as the '@syncodeindex'
command, except that it does not put the 'from' index entries into the
'@code' font; rather it puts them in the roman font.  Thus, you use
'@synindex' when you merge a concept index into a function index.

11.7 Defining New Indices
=========================

In addition to the predefined indices (*note Predefined Indices::), you
may use the '@defindex' and '@defcodeindex' commands to define new
indices.  These commands create new indexing @-commands with which you
mark index entries.  The '@defindex' command is used like this:

     @defindex NAME

   New index names are usually two-letter words, such as 'au'.  For
example:

     @defindex au

   This defines a new index, called the 'au' index.  At the same time,
it creates a new indexing command, '@auindex', that you can use to make
index entries.  Use this new indexing command just as you would use a
predefined indexing command.

   For example, here is a section heading followed by a concept index
entry and two 'au' index entries.

     @section Cognitive Semantics
     @cindex kinesthetic image schemas
     @auindex Johnson, Mark
     @auindex Lakoff, George

(Evidently, 'au' serves here as an abbreviation for "author".)

   Texinfo constructs the new indexing command by concatenating the name
of the index with 'index'; thus, defining an 'xy' index leads to the
automatic creation of an '@xyindex' command.

   Use the '@printindex' command to print the index, as you do with the
predefined indices.  For example:

     @node Author Index
     @unnumbered Author Index

     @printindex au

   The '@defcodeindex' command is like the '@defindex' command, except
that, in the printed output, it prints entries in an '@code' font by
default instead of in a roman font.

   You should define new indices before the end-of-header line of a
Texinfo file, and (of course) before any '@synindex' or '@syncodeindex'
commands (*note Texinfo File Header::).

   As mentioned earlier (*note Predefined Indices::), we recommend
having a single index in the final document whenever possible (no matter
however many source indices you use), since then readers have only one
place to look.

   When creating an index, TeX creates a file whose extension is the
name of the index (*note Names of index files::).  Therefore you should
avoid using index names that collide with extensions used for other
purposes, such as '.aux' or '.xml'.  'makeinfo' already reports an error
if a new index conflicts well-known extension name.

12.1 Special Characters: Inserting @ {} , \ # &
===============================================

'@' and curly braces are the basic special characters in Texinfo.  To
insert these characters so they appear in text, you must put an '@' in
front of these characters to prevent Texinfo from misinterpreting them.
Alphabetic commands are also provided.

   The other characters (comma, backslash, hash, ampersand) are special
only in restricted contexts, as explained in the respective sections.

* Menu:

* Inserting an Atsign::         '@@', '@atchar{}'.
* Inserting Braces::            '@{ @}', '@l rbracechar{}'.
* Inserting a Comma::           , and '@comma{}'.
* Inserting a Backslash::       \ and '@backslashchar{}'.
* Inserting a Hashsign::        # and '@hashchar{}'.
* Inserting an Ampersand::      & and '@ampchar{}'.
